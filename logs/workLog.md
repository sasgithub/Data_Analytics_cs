Work Log

I started off by looking at
<https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>.

A lot of data there, at least to store on my laptop. I started off just
downloading and examining the first file. An unzip -l let me see it's
just a CSV file and what I assume is the resource fork. I'm using Linux
so I don't care about the resource fork so I extracted it with unzip.

Examining the file I see the first line list the field names, they are
adequately descriptive which is good so I don't see anything else that
describes the data like a data dictionary or any file layout
documentation.

Looking at the data I see a good chunk of it's is the repeated station
names (start_station_name and end_station_name). Let's see how many
there are;

```bash
$ tail +2 202004-divvy-tripdata.csv | cut -f6 -d, | sort -u | wc -l
```
```text
602
```

So 602 unique station IDs

Let check the unique station names while were at it.

```bash
$ tail +2 202004-divvy-tripdata.csv | cut -f5 -d, | sort -u | wc -l
```
```text
602
```
Good 602 for each. Looks like there is are GPS coordinates (start_lat,
start_lng, end_lat, end_lng) which appear to match up perfectly with the
start and end station (what? Every start_station_id always has the same
start lat/long and likewise for the end_station_id and the end
lat/long).

My current plan is to dump all these tripdata.csv files into a database
with a rides table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE rides (
 ride_id CHAR(16) PRIMARY KEY,
 rideable_type INTEGER NOT NULL,
 start_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
 end_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
 start_station_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
 end_station_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
 member_type BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);
```

and a stations table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE stations (*
 station_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,*
 name TEXT NOT NULL,*
 latitude REAL NOT NULL CHECK(latitude BETWEEN -90 AND 90),*
 longitude REAL NOT NULL CHECK(longitude BETWEEN -180 AND 180)*
);
```

I'm still up in the air about the not nulls as I know there are rows
missing data, but I think some of it may be when the ride starts and
stops at the same station. So I either have to fix the nulls before
populating the table or write the code that inserts the data to fix
them. More investigation is necessary.

Let's grab a second file from the tripdata series and see if it's
consistent with the first, but let's skip saving the zip file since we
really only need the csv

aws s3 cp s3://divvy-tripdata/202005-divvy-tripdata.zip -
\--no-sign-request \--quiet 2\>/dev/null \| bsdtar -x -f --
202005-divvy-tripdata.csv

Well the good news is it appears to have the same format.

Now let's take a look at one of the the Stations_Trips series, namely
Divvy_Stations_Trips_2013.zip

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://divvy-tripdata/Divvy_Stations_Trips_2013.zip . --no-sign-request --quiet 2>/dev/null

$ unzip -l Divvy_Stations_Trips_2013.zip 
```

 93427432                     4 files
 ```

Not the same at all, let's have a look at the [README.txt](../data/Divvy_Stations_Trips_2013_README.txt).

So the rides (now called trips) table format is a little different and
there is some additional data. There is now a separate station table,
but for some reason both the station name and station id are still in
with the trips, at least the lat/long are only in the station table. The
additional data in the trips table is bike_id, it seems to have replaced
the rideable_type but there is no bikes table to find that out :-( Also
the ride_id, now trip_id, has changed from a 16 digit hex number to an
integer. The member_type is now called usertype and the values have
changed from (member, casual) to (Subscriber, Customer) still only two
values though. There is a new field called tripduration (I wonder if
it's just end time - start time, redundant data to store). Two other new
fields, gender and birthday, but it claims they are only populated for
Subscribers.

In the station table we have

id: station id
name: station name
latitude: station latitude
longitude: station longitude
dpcapacity: number of total docks at each station as of 2/7/2014
online date: date the station went live in the system

So dpcapacity and online date are new (or maybe we should say old since
it's from 2014)

Now for this Divvy_Stations_Trips_2013/Divvy_Stations_2013.shp.zip file

```bash
unzip -l Divvy_Stations_2013.shp.zip
```

I don't really recognize those file extensions let's see what the Linux
file command says;

```bash
$ file *

```

Was someone really using database software from the late 80s in 2013?
(on a total tangent I re-watched Office Space the other day and noticed
**Understanding dBASE III Plus** by Alan Simpson (Sybex Computer Books,
1st Ed. Jan 1986) on the shelf behind Peter.)

Looks like **file** didn't recognize the .prj file, it's small let's take a
look at it;

```bash
$ ls -l Divvy_Stations_2013.prj 
```
```text
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sas sas 145 Feb  6  2014 Divvy_Stations_2013.prj
```

It's small so ...

```bash
$ cat Divvy_Stations_2013.prj
```
```text 
GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]]
```

Turns out it's a

> "... Well-Known Text (WKT) definition of the dataset's coordinate

I dug in a little further and it's really interesting (I don't' know
much about GIS stuff) but I resisted the urge to explore it further.
However what I did not resist was the [side quest](../docs/side-quest/prj-quest.html) to fix **file** so that it would recognize .prj files.

```bash
$ file Divvy_Stations_2013.prj
```
```text 
Divvy_Stations_2013.prj: ESRI WKT projection (.prj) file
```

Another urge I couldn't resist was figuring out what those other files
were for, here's the breakdown;

Divvy_Stations_2013.dbf - essentially one tableâ€™s worth of data, rows and columns
Divvy_Stations_2013.prj  - the coordinate reference system and projection information
Divvy_Stations_2013.sbn - spatial index files used to speed up spatial queries
Divvy_Stations_2013.sbx - spatial index files used to speed up spatial queries
Divvy_Stations_2013.shp - stores the actual geometry (points, lines, or polygons)
Divvy_Stations_2013.shx - the index file, linking geometry to attributes

Turns out, strangely enough, that modern GIS tools still use the old
dBase III .dbf format when working with ERSI (Environmental Systems
Research Institute) shape files. Which means we can actually open this
stuff up and have a look at it.

[Divvy_Stations_in_QGIS.png](../images/Divvy_Stations_in_QGIS.png)

The above shows all the Divvy Stations from 2013, it's the only layer,
so not too interesting but if we right click on Divvy_Stations_2013 in
the Layers pane and select Open Attribute Table we get

[Divvy_Stations_table.png](../images/Divvy_Stations_table.png)

and there is the station data we already had, except now we get the
additional dpcapacity field.

It sure would be nice if we had a layer with Chicago city streets to go
with our layer of the stations. Looks like we should be able to get one
so a quick search turned up the Chicago Data Portal and after a few
404's I found the [Divvy Bicycle Stations Map](<https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Bicycle-Stations-Map/bk89-9dk7>)

[2025_Divvy_Stations.png](images/2025_Divvy_Stations.png)

Turns out we can download the current Stations data in CSV format from
this site and a review of the [terms of use](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/narr/foia/data_disclaimer.html) confirms what's required to be able to use it.

Not only that, but they also have Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv available for
download...

```bash
$ ls -hl Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv 
```
```text
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sas sas 4.8G May  1 13:28 Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv
```
That's a big'un

```bash
$ head -1 Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv
```
```text
TRIP ID,START TIME,STOP TIME,BIKE ID,TRIP DURATION,FROM STATION ID,FROM
STATION NAME,TO STATION ID,TO STATION NAME,USER TYPE,GENDER,BIRTH
YEAR,FROM LATITUDE,FROM LONGITUDE,FROM LOCATION,TO LATITUDE,TO
LONGITUDE,TO LOCATION
```

What a lovely caps-lock-a-ram-a that is. I like the new fields
(compared to Divvy_Trips_2013.csv) and their description's for brevity,
but I'm going to stick with the pervious convention of all lower case
(no need to shout).

gender 
:   Only populated for Subscribers

birth_year
:   I wonder if it's only populated for Subscribers

from_location 
:   this appears to be the from_latitude and from_longitude stuck in parentheses seperated by a space and in the reverse order and in front of that opening parenthesis is the string "POINT " , so something like "POINT (-87.745261 41.886841)"

to_location
:   this appears to be like from_location only with

to_latitude 
:   as above.

to_longitude
:   as above.

So we'll update the planned rides table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE rides (
 ride_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 bike\_type INTEGER,
 bike_id INTEGER,
 start_time INTEGER NOT NULL,
 end_time INTEGER NOT NULL,
 start_station_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
 end_station_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
 user\_type BOOLEAN CHECK (user_type IN (0, 1) OR user_type IS NULL),
 gender BOOLEAN CHECK (gender IN (0, 1) OR gender IS NULL),
 birth_year INTEGER *
);
```

Now I'm curious how far back this data goes, so let's create something
to efficiently find out before we spend any time wrangling this data. If
you listen carefully you can almost hear this big'ol 4.8GB file
whispering the word "awk"

We create the file [speed_dating.awk](../src/speed_dating.awk)

```bash
$ awk -f speed_dating.awk Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv
```
```text
Earliest: 06/27/2013
Latest:   //STOP
```

Well, I guess I forgot to skip the first line, that STOP is from "STOP
TIME".

OK fixed that;

```bash
$ awk -f ~/git/Data_Analytics_cs/src/speed_dating.awk  Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv 
```
```text
Earliest: 06/27/2013
Latest:   01/06/2020
```

That was kind of slow, around 20 seconds, so I tried a bunch of things
even tried a python version ([speed_dating.py](../src/speed_dating.py)), but nothing was really better until I tried a go version ([speed_dating.go](../src/speed_dating.go)),

```bash
$ speed_dating 
```
```text
Earliest: 06/27/2013
Latest:   01/21/2020
```

Down to 7.5 seconds. I could make it multi-threaded and it'd be even
fast, but don't fall into that trap. I'd already spent an hour to save
13 seconds. Don't waste time optimizing something your only going to use
once.

So we've got data from the middle of 2013 to the beginning of 2020,
let's go ahead and create a database and the two tables with updated
rows.

```R
CREATE TABLE stations (
 station_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT NOT NULL,
 short_name TEXT,
 lat REAL NOT NULL CHECK(lat BETWEEN -90 AND 90),
 long REAL NOT NULL CHECK(long BETWEEN -180 AND 180),
 dbcap INTEGER,
 online_date TEXT
);
```

Since there is no consistent station ID between the various version of
the rides/trips tables, so we'll create an index on the name field so
that we can validate the stations as they are imported.

Create unique index idx_name on stations(name);

We'll start off with the station files.

Divvy_Bicycle_Stations_20250501.csv
Divvy_Stations_Trips_2013.zip
Divvy_Stations_Trips_2014_Q1Q2.zip
Divvy_Stations_Trips_2014_Q3Q4.zip

Ran into some duplicate stations names after importing stations from
Divvy_Stations_Trips_2013.zip

```text
  ---------------------------- -----------------------
  Station Name                 Number of Occurrences
  Burling St & Diversey Pkwy   2
  Clark St & Newport St        2
  Indiana Ave & 133rd St       2
  Western Ave & Lake St        2
  ---------------------------- -----------------------
```

So I added a " II" to the end of the name for the station with the
highest (most were numbers) short name. It looked like these might have
multiple areas with docks.

Even more problem with Divvy_Stations_Trips_2014_Q1Q2.zip as there was
no CSV file with stations only an Excel spreadsheet so I had to export
that to CSV. Also the naming convention was different so I gave up the
idea of having a single script that could import both the rides and stations in sequence as there were just too many exceptions to handle. I went with this streamlined script to import
stations.

I ended up dropping the unique index on station name in favor of

```SQL
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uniq_vector ON stations(name, lat, long);
CREATE INDEX idx_name on stations(name);
```

That allowed me to insert duplicate station names if their lat and long
were different and ignore them if they were the same

```bash
"INSERT or IGNORE INTO stations (name, short_name, lat, long, dbcap,
online_date) VALUES ('$name', '$short_name', '$lat',
'$long', '$dbcap', '$online_date');"
```

That however led to another issue, the same station with multiple GPS
coordinates. It appears that the old entries had lower precision
entries. One assumes they were taken with less precise hardware by
different people and from slightly different spots. Are you interested
in a side quest about calculating the distance between two pair of GPS
coordinates? If not, just cut to the chase and use [dist-diff.sh](../src/dist-diff.sh).

Anyway, since we don't want to have to store the GPS coordinates in the
rides table (to keep it's size under control) and we don't want to keep
the station name either (same reason). So we need to be able to match up
rides with the right stations.

We'll do most of this matching as we insert rides. Have a look at
[load_rides.sh](../src/load_rides.sh), it handles selecting the station_id for start_stations and end_station, based on the stations_name and the GPS coordinates. It also converts gender and
user_type to boolean and converts dates and date/times to UNIX epoch for
storage as an integer.

Had a bit of an issue right off, I was trying to use a single
transaction for each imported CSV file for efficiency, but ran into an
issue with locks at about 20,000 records in to the import. So I ended up
doing transactions of 10,000 at a time. Still reasonably efficient, but
less problematic.

While Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv is importing, we'll go ahead and create a
view

```SQL
CREATE VIEW rider_readable AS
SELECT
  ride_id,
  bike_type,
  bike_id,
  datetime(start_time, 'unixepoch') AS start_time,
  datetime(end_time, 'unixepoch') AS end_time,
  start_station_id,
  end_station_id,
  CASE user_type
    WHEN 0 THEN 'subscriber'
    WHEN 1 THEN 'customer'
    ELSE 'unknown'
  END AS user_type,
  CASE gender
    WHEN 0 THEN 'male'
    WHEN 1 THEN 'female'
    ELSE 'unknown'
  END AS gender,
  birth_year
FROM rides
```

If one wanted they could create triggers to allow inserts and updates
via rider_readable and allow the use of the more friendly text version
(male/female, subscriber/customer), but I don't think I'll do that as 0
and 1 are faster to type. If I get some time after I've published this
I'll add a link (if this isn't a hyperlink then I'm lazy) that shows
the steps to add the triggers.

One thing I discovered was the SQLite doesn't handle time zones. Since
all the time are stored in UNIX epoch and thus UTC all the times
returned by SQLite will be UTC so we'll have to remember to adjust
manually (I really hate daylight savings time).

After a very long time loading Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv I went a head
and verified the time period covered

```bash
sqlite> SELECT
 MIN(start_time) AS earliest_start_time,
 MAX(end_time) AS latest_end_time
FROM rider_readable;
```

```text
earliest_start_time   latest_end_time 
-------------------  -------------------
2013-06-27 06:06:00  2020-04-26 23:12:03
```

```bash
sqlite\> select count(\*) from rides ;
```
20080914

Well that explains why it took so long.

****In Chicago**** the COVID-19 pandemic followed a timeline similar to
global and national trends with the first case in Chicago January 24,
2020, a woman returning from Wuhan China. Community spread in Chicago
was confirmed by early March 2020 and the lockdown began March 21, 2020.
I'd guess that's the reason the data end shortly after. I think it's
safest to avoid the pandemic in our analyses as that's just another
variable to try and control for.

We can use the UNIX date command to deal with the time zone issues and
find the epoch time we need

```bash
$ date --date="Jan 24, 2020 00:00 CST" "+%s"
```
1579845600

Let's see how many records are effected

```bash
sqlite > select count(*) from rides where start_time > 1579845600;
```
```text
*count(\*)*
--------
1 
```

That's a little strange.

```bash
sqlite > select start_time, end_time from rides where start_time > 1579845600 ;
```
```text
start_time end_time 
---------- ----------
1587941114 1587942723
```

So, Sun Apr 26 05:45:14 PM CDT 2020 to Sun Apr 26 06:12:03 PM CDT 2020.
Well, how many records are there in 2020?

```bash
$ date \--date=\"Jan 1, 2020 00:00 CST\" \"+%s\"
```
1577858400

```SQL
sqlite > select count(*) from rides where start_time > 1577858400;
```
```text
count(*)
--------
1 
```

So it's an outlier, we'll delete it since we were deleting all the stuff
during the pandemic anyway.

```bash
sqlite > delete from rides where start_time > 1577858400;
```

Let's look at December 31^st^ just to make sure we've got rides

```bash
sqlite > select count(*) from rides where start_time > 1577772000;
```
```text
count(*)
--------
2134 
```

Seems like a lot for New Years eve in Chicago, but maybe the weather was
nice, either way we've got data through the end of 2019. I don't see any
data earlier than what we have in S3, so we just need to load the post
pandemic data now. The "Emergency" officially ended May 11, 2023, we'll
grab the data starting in June of 2023.

With these "smaller" files it was nice to just add the following zip
file names to rideFiles and then let [load_rides.sh](../src/load_rides.sh) do all the work

202306-divvy-tripdata.zip
202307-divvy-tripdata.zip

While this was cranking away I started looking at weather data. Seems to
me that weather may be a big differentiator between casual users and
subscribers. I found Meteostat which provides historical weather data
under the distributed under the terms of the [CC BY-NC 4.0
license](https://dev.meteostat.net/terms). I signed up for their free
plan to get an API key and searched for the nearby stations using the
lat/long from a randomly selected Divvy bike stations.

```bash
$ curl --request GET --url
'https://meteostat.p.rapidapi.com/stations/nearby?lat=41.8759&lon=-87.6305'
--header 'x-rapidapi-host: meteostat.p.rapidapi.com' --header
"x-rapidapi-key: $MYAPIKEY"*
```
```text

You don't actually need an API key to get bulk downloads

```bash
$ curl \"https://bulk.meteostat.net/v2/hourly/KCGX0.csv.gz" --output "KCGX0.csv.gz"
```

It would have been nice to have data from Central Station but after
downloading it I discovered it started in 1971 and ended in 1999. Midway
Airport may have to do

```bash
$ curl "https://bulk.meteostat.net/v2/hourly/72534.csv.gz" --output "72534.csv.gz"
```

Midway Airports data runs from 1973 to present so I'll drop the stuff
before our earliest time 2013-06-27 06:06:00 and then import what's left
into the database, throwing away any fields we don't want to use.

CSV files provided through the Meteostat bulk data interface use commas
as separators. Each file provides the following columns:

  ---- ------ -------------------------------------------- ---------
  1    date   The date string (format: YYYY-MM-DD)         String
  2    hour   The hour (UTC)                               Integer
  3    temp   The air temperature in Â°C                    Float
  4    dwpt   The dew point in Â°C                          Float
  5    rhum   The relative humidity in percent (%)         Integer
  6    prcp   The one hour precipitation total in mm       Float
  7    snow   The snow depth in mm                         Integer
  8    wdir   The wind direction in degrees (Â°)            Integer
  9    wspd   The average wind speed in km/h               Float
  10   wpgt   The peak wind gust in km/h                   Float
  11   pres   The sea-level air pressure in hPa            Float
  12   tsun   The one hour sunshine total in minutes (m)   Integer
  13   coco   The weather condition code                   Integer
  ---- ------ -------------------------------------------- ---------

More information on the data formats and weather condition codes (COCO)
is available [here](https://dev.meteostat.net/formats.html) and included
below;.

Weather conditions are indicated by an integer value between 1 and 27
according to this list:

  ---- ---------------------
  1    Clear
  2    Fair
  3    Cloudy
  4    Overcast
  5    Fog
  6    Freezing Fog
  7    Light Rain
  8    Rain
  9    Heavy Rain
  10   Freezing Rain
  11   Heavy Freezing Rain
  12   Sleet
  13   Heavy Sleet
  14   Light Snowfall
  15   Snowfall
  16   Heavy Snowfall
  17   Rain Shower
  18   Heavy Rain Shower
  19   Sleet Shower
  20   Heavy Sleet Shower
  21   Snow Shower
  22   Heavy Snow Shower
  23   Lightning

  25   Thunderstorm
  26   Heavy Thunderstorm
  27   Storm
  ---- ---------------------

The data from Midway contains no entries for snow, peak wind gust or
total sunsine (minutes). So we can drop those columns. Also most people
do not consciously notice changes in air pressure, unless it\'s extreme.
Factors like precipitation, temperature and wind speed, have a far
stronger and more direct influence on bike usage. While air pressure
might correlate with some weather conditions (e.g., low pressure with
storms), it\'s not the pressure itself that influences behavior---it\'s
the weather phenomena that accompany it. So we'll be dropping air
pressure as well.

We'll go ahead and load this in to R and drop the columns and convert
the date and hour column to a datetime column and then convert that into
UNIX epoch format since the rides datetime is already in that format and
it will allow for easy joins and faster comparisons. Also the Midway
data did not contain any column headings, so we'll add them since it's
easier than adding them later in R.

Now we'll create a table for this data in SQLite

```R
> install.packages("RSQLite")
> con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "/home/sas/classes/Google/data-analytics/data/caseStudy.db")
> dbExecute(con, "
+    CREATE TABLE hourly_weather (
+      epoch INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
+      temp REAL,
+      dwpt REAL,
+      rhum INTEGER,
+      prcp REAL,
+      wdir INTEGER,
+      wspd REAL,
+      coco INTEGER
+   )
+ ")
[1] 0
>
>
> dbWriteTable(con, "hourly_weather", df, append = TRUE)
```
Warning message:
Column names will be matched ignoring character case

Now it's time for some weather. First off it would be nice if the rides
were broken down by hour like the weather data. So let's create a view
that does that.

```SQL
CREATE VIEW rides_per_hour AS
SELECT
  CAST((start_time / 3600) * 3600 AS INTEGER) AS epoch, -- start of hour 
  CASE user_type
       WHEN 0 THEN 'subscriber'
       WHEN 1 THEN 'customer'
  END AS user_type,
  COUNT(*) AS rides
FROM rides
GROUP BY epoch, user_type;
```


Now we can create a table with one entry per hour that joins rides and
weather

```SQL
CREATE TABLE rides_per_hour_tbl AS
SELECT
  CAST((start_time / 3600) * 3600 AS INTEGER) AS epoch,
  CASE user_type WHEN 0 THEN 'subscriber'
                 WHEN 1 THEN 'customer'
                 ELSE 'unknown' END          AS user_type,
  COUNT(*) AS rides
FROM rides
GROUP BY epoch, user_type;
```

Let's create an index so we don't have divide by 3600 for every row
every time

```SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_rides_per_hour_epoch
  ON rides_per_hour_tbl(epoch, user_type);
```

Now we'll add a view that joins with the weather data

```SQL
CREATE VIEW rides_weather AS
SELECT
  w.epoch                          AS epoch,        -- seconds since 1970â€‘01â€‘01 UTC
  r.user_type,
  COALESCE(r.rides, 0)             AS rides,        -- 0 if no trips that hour
  w.temp,
  w.dwpt,
  w.rhum,
  w.prcp,
  w.wdir,
  w.wspd,
  w.coco
FROM hourly_weather AS w
LEFT JOIN rides_per_hour AS r
       ON r.epoch = w.epoch
```       

Now we'll do some **data integrity checks **first we'll look for time
travelers

```SQL
select count(\*) from rides where start_time \> end_time;
```
190

Cyclistic has a strict no time travel policy to avoid any paradoxes that
might arise, so we'll drop those rows

```SQL
delete from riders where start_time > end_time;
```

Next up those zero length rides

```SQL
select count(*) from rides where start_time = end_time and
start_station_id = end_station_id;
```
624

If they took no time and went nowhere that shouldn't count as a ride...
so

```SQL
delete from rides where start_time = end_time and start_station_id =
end_station_id;
```

Where there any that took no time, but did go somewhere?

```SQL
select count(*) from rides where start_time = end_time and
start_station_id <> end_station_id;
```
100

To go somewhere in zero time implies teleportation and Cyclistic has a
rule against using it's bikes for teleportation. In any event
teleportation does not count as a ride

```SQL
delete from rides where start_time = end_time and start_station_id \<\>
end_station_id;
```

We could look at conflicts where a bike is in use on more than one ride
at the same time, but that query is harry, given there are more than 28
million rows with a non null bike_id and 6526 unique bike_id's.

```SQL
select count(*) from rides where bike_id <> '';
```
20080691

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bike_id) AS unique_bikes FROM rides;
```
6526

So I think as a compromise we'll grab a small sample of bikes and check
them for conflicts. I think doing just one should let us get an idea of
how long this will take and how big a sample we can use.

```SQL
select bike_id from rides where bike_id <> '' order by random() limit 1;
```
2311

Yea, yea, it's not random but good enough for a test.

```SQL
SELECT a.ride_id AS ride_a,
       b.ride_id AS ride_b,
       a.start_time AS start_a,
       a.end_time AS end_a,
       b.start_time AS start_b,
       b.end_time AS end_b
FROM rides a
JOIN rides b
  ON a.bike_id = b.bike_id
 AND a.ride_id < b.ride_id  -- avoid duplicate and self-pairs
 AND a.end_time > b.start_time
 AND a.start_time < b.end_time
WHERE a.bike_id = '2311' limit 10;
```
```text
rride_a  ride_b  start_a     end_a       start_b     end_b     
------  ------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
19178   20842   1385590980  1385591220  1385590980  1385591220
```

Well that looks suspiciously like a duplicate

```SQL
select \* from rides where ride_id = 19178 or ride_id = 20842;
```
```text
ride_id  bike_type  bike_id  start_time  end_time    start_station_id  end_station_id  user_type  gender  birth_year
-------  ---------  -------  ----------  ----------  ----------------  --------------  ---------  ------  ----------
19178               2311     1385590980  1385591220  1247              1074            0          0       1982      
20842               2311     1385590980  1385591220  1247              1074            0          0       1982 
```

I had hoped we wouldn't have a lot of duplicates as my cursory
examination of the CSV files showed they were sorted by start_time and I
didn't see any duplicates, but of course I only looked at a tiny amount
of the data. So we'll have to clean up the duplicates. Let's make a
backup copy of the database first. With SQLite it as simple as making a
copy of the database, as long as nothing is writing to the database.

cp caseStudy.db caseStudy_backup.db

Now let's take a look at just how many duplicates there are

```SQL
SELECT count(\*) FROM rides WHERE rowid NOT IN (
SELECT MIN(rowid) FROM rides GROUP BY bike_id, start_time, end_time
) ;
```
```text
count(*)
--------
2767
```

Well that's not too bad out of more than 28 million rows.

```SQL
delete
FROM rides
WHERE rowid NOT IN (
SELECT MIN(rowid)
FROM rides
GROUP BY bike_id, start_time, end_time
) ;
```
```bash
sqlite > select count(*) from rides;
```
```text
count(*)
--------
28386573
```

So now back to looking at rides on a bike that have overlapping times

```SQL
SELECT a.ride_id AS ride_a,
       b.ride_id AS ride_b,
       a.start_time AS start_a,
       a.end_time AS end_a,
       b.start_time AS start_b,
       b.end_time AS end_b
FROM rides a
JOIN rides b
  ON a.bike_id = b.bike_id
 AND a.ride_id < b.ride_id  -- avoid duplicate and self-pairs
 AND a.end_time > b.start_time
 AND a.start_time < b.end_time limit 10;
```
```text
ride_a  ride_b  start_a     end_a       start_b     end_b     
------  ------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
38307   38341   1374774420  1374774480  1374774360  1374774480

```

Cleaning that up a bit

```SQL
select ride_id, bike_id as bike, start_time, end_time, start_station_id as start, end_station_id as end from rider_readable where ride_id in (38307, 38341, 70772, 71240, 72510, 72511, 96565, 96570, 96571, 96573, 96574);
```

```

We've got a couple of 1 minute rides that didn't go anywhere and a 2
minute ride that didn't go anywhere. Those don't sound like successful
rides, so off then go

```SQL
delete from rides where ride_id in (38307, 38341, 71240);
```

We've got a 10 minute and an 11 minute ride with the same bike between
the same stations. We'll keep the one with the smallest ride_id

```SQL
delete from rides where ride_id = 72511;
```

Now we have 5 rides that start within 4 minutes and end within 2 minutes
of each other and use the same bike between the same stations. So again
we keep the one with the smallest ride_id

```SQL
delete from rides where ride_id in (96570, 96571, 96573, 96574);
```

Let's take a look at the breakdown of rides between subscribers and
casual riders

```SQL
SELECT user_type, COUNT(*) AS Rides
FROM rides
GROUP BY user_type;
```
```text
user_type  Rides   
---------  --------
           194     
0          20519211
1          7867354 
```

We need to investigate those 194 who aren't subscribers or causal
riders.

```SQL
select count(*) from rides where user_type IS NULL;
```
```text
count(*)
--------
194 
```

So they are all NULL. They won't be any use in determining how
subscribers and casual riders differ, so we'll go ahead and drop these.

```SQL
delete from rides where user_type IS NULL;
```

*Now we can finally start doing some real analyses.*

We'll start by looking at record counts of all the tables. First we'll
run a query to generate the SQL statement for all that tables.

```SQL
SELECT 
  'SELECT ''' || name || ''' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "' || name || '"' || 
  ' UNION ALL '
FROM 
  sqlite_master
WHERE 
  type='table' AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%';
SELECT 'stations' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "stations" UNION ALL 
SELECT 'rides' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "rides" UNION ALL 
SELECT 'hourly_weather' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "hourly_weather" UNION ALL 
SELECT 'rides_per_hour_tbl' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "rides_per_hour_tbl" UNION ALL
```

We need to trim that "UNION ALL" off the last line. Then we just run the
query

```SQL
SELECT 'stations' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "stations" UNION ALL 
SELECT 'rides' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "rides" UNION ALL 
SELECT 'hourly_weather' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "hourly_weather" UNION ALL 
SELECT 'rides_per_hour_tbl' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM "rides_per_hour_tbl" ;
```
```text
table_name          row_count
------------------  ---------
stations            1276     
rides               28386565 
hourly_weather      104099   
rides_per_hour_tbl  139994   
```

Getting the MAX ride times for subscribers and customers

```SQL
select ride_id, max(end_time-start_time), user_type from rides group by user_type; 
```
```text
ride_id   max(end_time-start_time)  user_type
--------  ------------------------  ---------
16712679  11469071                  0        
16149308  11635045                  1
```

That's a long time, I hope those bikes have comfortable seats. I wonder
how many of these long rides there are?

```SQL
select count(*) as longer_than_a_month, user_type from rides where end_time-start_time > 2592000 group by user_type; 
```
```text
longer_than_a_month  user_type
-------------------  ---------
27                   0        
124                  1
```

OK, it wasn't a month it was 30 days ... how about a week

```SQL
select count(*) as longer_than_a_week, user_type from rides where
end_time-start_time > 604800 group by user_type; 
```
```text
longer_than_a_week  user_type
------------------  ---------
126                 0        
703                 1  
```

Longer than a day

```SQL
select count(*) as longer_than_a_day, user_type from rides where end_time-start_time > 604800 group by user_type; 
```
```text
longer_than_a_day  user_type
-----------------  ---------
126                0        
703                1 
```

That's good news, so we have less than 1000 of these "long rides". The
question is what to do about them. I'd love to delete them but I think
it's better to just make sure we exclude them from any queries where
they may skew the results. Like what we're looking at next, the average
ride length

```SQL
SELECT
  CASE user_type
       WHEN 0 THEN 'subscriber'
       WHEN 1 THEN 'customer'
  END                           AS user_type,
  ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 1)          AS avg_seconds,
  ROUND(AVG((end_time - start_time) / 60.0), 1) AS avg_minutes
FROM rides where end_time - start_time < 86400                                                  
GROUP BY user_type
ORDER BY user_type; 
```
```text
user_type   avg_seconds  avg_minutes
----------  -----------  -----------
customer    1753.1       29.2       
subscriber  730.9        12.2     
```

So customer's rides are a little less than 3 times longer than
subscriber's rides. I wonder what that looks like broken out by weekdays

```SQL
SELECT
  /* translate user_type codes just like in rider_readable */
  CASE user_type
       WHEN 0 THEN 'subscriber'
       WHEN 1 THEN 'customer'
  END                                         AS user_type,
  /* weekday number 0â€“6 */
  strftime('%w', start_time, 'unixepoch')     AS weekday_num,
  /* nicer label: Sun, Mon, â€¦ */
  CASE strftime('%w', start_time, 'unixepoch')
       WHEN '0' THEN 'Sun'

  END                                         AS weekday,
  /* average ride length */
  ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 1)        AS avg_seconds,
  ROUND(AVG((end_time - start_time) / 60.0),1) AS avg_minutes
FROM rides  where end_time - start_time < 86400
GROUP BY user_type, weekday
ORDER BY user_type, weekday_num; 
```
```text

Well, rides are longer on the weekends as I expected, but not by much
and the same holds true for both subscribers and customers. Not what I
was expecting, I kind of expected to see much longer rides for customers
on the weekends. Oh well, follow the data.

Now let's see who's taking those midnight rides

```SQL
SELECT
  /* translate the userâ€‘type codes */
  CASE user_type
       WHEN 0 THEN 'subscriber'
       WHEN 1 THEN 'customer'
  END                                   AS user_type,

  /* twoâ€‘digit hour in local time 00â€‘23 */
  strftime('%H', start_time, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') AS hour_of_day,

  COUNT(*)                              AS ride_count
FROM rides
GROUP BY user_type, hour_of_day
ORDER BY user_type, hour_of_day;        -- keeps 00â†’23 order
```

Is it just me or does it seem odd to have that many rides starting in
the middle of the night. Don't forget these times of UTC.

Let's look at the breakdown of the number of rides by weekday

```SQL
SELECT 
  CASE strftime('%w', start_time, 'unixepoch')
    WHEN '0' THEN 'Sun'
    WHEN '1' THEN 'Mon'
    WHEN '2' THEN 'Tue'
    WHEN '3' THEN 'Wed'
    WHEN '4' THEN 'Thu'
    WHEN '5' THEN 'Fri'
    WHEN '6' THEN 'Sat'
  END AS weekday,
  COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM 
  rides
GROUP BY 
  weekday
ORDER BY 
  strftime('%w', start_time, 'unixepoch'); --ensures proper weekday order
```  
```text
weekday  ride_count
-------  ----------
Sun      3747953   
Mon      3935207   
Tue      4128171   
Wed      4151033   
Thu      4135719   
Fri      4239732   
Sat      4052638
```

Then we should also have a look the number of rides by months

```SQL
SELECT 
  CASE strftime('%m', start_time, 'unixepoch')
    WHEN '01' THEN 'Jan'
    WHEN '02' THEN 'Feb'
    WHEN '03' THEN 'Mar'
    WHEN '04' THEN 'Apr'
    WHEN '05' THEN 'May'
    WHEN '06' THEN 'Jun'
    WHEN '07' THEN 'Jul'
    WHEN '08' THEN 'Aug'
    WHEN '09' THEN 'Sep'
    WHEN '10' THEN 'Oct'
    WHEN '11' THEN 'Nov'
    WHEN '12' THEN 'Dec'
  END AS weekday,
  COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM 
  rides
GROUP BY 
  weekday
ORDER BY 
  strftime('%m', start_time, 'unixepoch'); --ensures proper month order
```  
```text

Thinking about how customers use bikes and how they might be converted
to subscribers, it seems that one class of customer is very unlikely to
be converted, and that is tourist. The vast majority of them won't be
local and thus would never consider a subscription. So if we look at
only the stations not near tourist attractions, we'll likely see a lower
percentage of tourist rides.

So I manually collected 24 tourist attractions GPS coordinate from
Google Maps and we'll use those to cull the stations for the next steps
in the analysis.

```R
> library(geosphere)
> stations_df <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT station_id, name, latitude AS lat, longitude AS long FROM stations")
> attractions_df <- read.csv("/home/sas/classes/Google/data-analytics/data/tourist_attractions.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
>
> find_nearby_stations <- function(attraction, stations, radius = 200) {
+     print(attraction)  # or print(attraction[c("long", "lat")])
+     
+     coords <- as.numeric(unlist(attraction[c("long", "lat")]))
+     
+     distances <- distHaversine(
+         matrix(c(stations$long, stations$lat), ncol = 2),
+         coords
+     )
+     
+     nearby <- stations[distances <= radius, ]
+     nearby$distance_m <- distances[distances <= radius]
+     nearby$attraction <- attraction$name
+     return(nearby)
+ }
```

Combine the nearby stations into a dataframe

```R
> nearby_stations_df <- bind_rows(nearby_stations_list)
```

Exclude These from the Full Stations List

```R
> 
> stations_non_tourist_df <- stations_df %>%
+     filter(!(name %in% nearby_stations_df$name))
>
```

Now we'll create an SQL statement to select rides between non-tourist
stations for customers, but let's get a count first to see if R can
handle that much data.

```R
> station_ids_sql <- paste(sprintf("%s", stations_non_tourist_df$station_id), collapse = ", ")
> 
> count_query <- sprintf("
+   SELECT COUNT(*) AS n
+   FROM rides
+   WHERE user_type = 1
+     AND start_station_id IN (%s)
+     AND end_station_id IN (%s)
+ ", station_ids_sql, station_ids_sql)
> 
> ride_count <- dbGetQuery(con, count_query)$n
> print(ride_count)
[1] 6014004
```

That's probably at the limit for R Studio on my laptop, so we'll take
the safe route and try just rides after the introduction of e-bikes

```R
> 
> station_ids_sql <- paste(sprintf("%s", stations_non_tourist_df$station_id), collapse = ", ")
> 
> count_query <- sprintf("
+   SELECT COUNT(*) AS n
+   FROM rides
+   WHERE user_type = 1
+     AND start_station_id IN (%s)
+     AND end_station_id IN (%s)
+     AND start_time >= strftime('%%s', '2023-01-01')
+ ", station_ids_sql, station_ids_sql)
> 
> ride_count <- dbGetQuery(con, count_query)$n
> print(ride_count)
[1] 2476187
```

That's manageable.

```R
> ride_query <- sprintf("
+   SELECT
+     ride_id,
+     start_time,
+     end_time,
+     start_station_id,
+     end_station_id,
+     bike_type
+   FROM rides
+   WHERE user_type = 1
+     AND start_station_id IN (%s)
+     AND end_station_id IN (%s)
+     AND start_time >= strftime('%%s', '2023-01-01')
+ ", station_ids_sql, station_ids_sql)
> 
> non_tourist_customer_rides_df <- dbGetQuery(con, ride_query)
> 
```

```R

I was a little concerned when I saw the lat and long with only 3
significant digits, but I checked, that's just R deciding to be too
smart for it's own good. There is a real problem though, Streeter Dr &
Grand Ave is a big tourist area near Navy Pier. Unfortunately not near
enough.

```R
> 
> library(geosphere)
> distances <- distHaversine(
+     matrix(c(streeter_coords$long, streeter_coords$lat), nrow=1),
+     matrix(c(attractions_df$long, attractions_df$lat), ncol=2)
+ )
> 
> closest_idx <- which.min(distances)
> closest_attraction <- attractions_df[closest_idx, ]
> 
> closest_attraction
       Name      lat      long
1 Navy Pier 41.89198 -87.60512
> 
> # Distance in meters to the closest attraction
> closest_distance_meters <- distances[closest_idx]
> 
> closest_distance_meters
[1] 574.9555
```

Since the aim is to exclude tourist we'll have to recalculate the
non-tourist stations with a bigger radius, say 600.

```R
> find_nearby_stations <- function(attraction, stations, radius = 600) {
+     print(attraction)  # or print(attraction[c("long", "lat")])
+     
+     coords <- as.numeric(unlist(attraction[c("long", "lat")]))
+     
+     distances <- distHaversine(
+         matrix(c(stations$long, stations$lat), ncol = 2),
+         coords
+     )
+     
+     nearby <- stations[distances <= radius, ]
+     nearby$distance_m <- distances[distances <= radius]
+     nearby$attraction <- attraction$name
+     return(nearby)
+ }
> 

> nearby_stations_df <- bind_rows(nearby_stations_list)

That was kind of disappointing, expected to see a stronger case for
commuters than we did. Oh well on to take a look at the duration of
these non-tourist rides. But first a little cleanup that data frame is
getting bloated.

```R
> non_tourist_customer_rides_df$hour_utc <- NULL 
> non_tourist_customer_rides_df$start_datetime_utc <- NULL 
> non_tourist_customer_rides_df$start_datetime <- NULL 
> non_tourist_customer_rides_df$month <- NULL 
```

Now let's add the ride duration in minutes.

```R
> non_tourist_customer_rides_df <- non_tourist_customer_rides_df %>%
+     mutate(
+         ride_length_min = (end_time - start_time) / 60
+     )
> 
```

Since we know the only a few outliers rides are longer than 200 minutes
and the 1 minute rides are probably noise

> non_tourist_customer_rides_df <- non_tourist_customer_rides_df %>%
+     filter(ride_length_min > 1, ride_length_min < 200)
> 
> 
> non_tourist_customer_rides_df <- non_tourist_customer_rides_df %>%
+     filter(ride_length_min < 150)
> 
> 
> ggplot(non_tourist_customer_rides_df, aes(x = ride_length_min)) +
+     geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "darkorange", color = "white") +
+     labs(
+         title = "Non-Tourist Customer Ride Duration Distribution",
+         x = "Ride Length (minutes)",
+         y = "Number of Rides"
+     ) +
+     theme_minimal()
> 
```

We can probably go down to 150 for these

```R
> 
> non_tourist_customer_rides_df <- non_tourist_customer_rides_df %>%
+     filter(ride_length_min < 150)
> 
> 
> ggplot(non_tourist_customer_rides_df, aes(x = ride_length_min)) +
+     geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "darkorange", color = "white") +
+     labs(
+         title = "Non-Tourist Customer Ride Duration Distribution",
+         x = "Ride Length (minutes)",
+         y = "Number of Rides"
+     ) +
+     theme_minimal()
> 
```

A smoother option

```R
> ggplot(non_tourist_customer_rides_df, aes(x = ride_length_min)) +
+     geom_density(fill = "darkorange") +
+     labs(
+         title = "Non-Tourist Customer Ride Duration Density",
+         x = "Ride Length (minutes)",
+         y = "Density"
+     ) +
+     theme_minimal()
```

Now let's break it down by weekday vs weekend.

```R
> ggplot(non_tourist_customer_rides_df, aes(x = ride_length_min, fill = week_part)) +
+     geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
+     scale_fill_manual(values = c("Weekday" = "darkblue", "Weekend" = "darkorange")) +
+     labs(
+         title = "Non-Tourist Customer Ride Duration by Weekday vs Weekend",
+         x = "Ride Length (minutes)",
+         fill = "Day Type"
+     ) +
+     theme_minimal()
> 
```


Did we look at the overall rides per year yet?  I think we missed that one.

```SQL
sqlite> select strftime('%Y', start_time, 'unixepoch') as year, count(*) from rides group by year order by year;
```
```text
year  count(*)
