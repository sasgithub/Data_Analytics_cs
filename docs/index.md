# ðŸš² How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

This project began as the capstone case study for the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), which presents a fictional company named **Cyclistic**. The business goal:  
**Determine how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently â€” and identify strategies to convert more casual users into annual members.**

To bring this scenario into the real world, I extended the analysis using **actual Divvy bike-share data** from the City of Chicago, covering rides from 2013 through early 2025. I also incorporated **hourly weather data** and **geospatial analysis** to enhance the depth and utility of the findings.

## ðŸ“š Project Context

This project satisfies the requirements of the Google Data Analytics capstone while also serving as a portfolio piece demonstrating:

- Independent sourcing and integration of multi-year real-world data
- Use of tools beyond the course scope (e.g., SQLite, Leaflet, Tableau, shell scripting)
- Realistic data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis

The fictional business challenge of **Cyclistic** is explored through the lens of actual **Divvy** usage patterns.
