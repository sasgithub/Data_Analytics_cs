We break from the normal color scheme as more contrast was required due to the preexisting colors in the map. So the dots for subscriber stations rendered in blue and the dots for customer stations rendered in red. The dots for stations are offset slightly to avoid one dot obscuring the other for the cases where the station is in the top 50 for both subscribers and customers. This is accomplished by using a data frame where the location of the stations is offset. The size of the dots is scaled by the total number of rides (subscriber or customer as appropriate), so that stations with more rides are larger dots.\nIt was created in R using Leaflet.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nThis interactive map shows the top 10 most frequently traveled station-to-station ride paths for a selected rider group—All Riders, Subscribers, or Customers. Line colors indicate ride volume, revealing distinct spatial usage patterns: casual riders concentrate near the lakefront and tourist zones, while subscribers follow more distributed, commuter-aligned routes.

The x-axis represents the distance in kilometers between two stations, and the y-axis represents the relative density of those ride distances.\n\n##### Chart Details\n\n-   X-Axis: Distance Between Stations (km), ranging from 0 to just over 30 km\n\n-   Y-Axis: Relative density of rides occurring at each distance\n\n-   Plot Style: Area-under-curve density plot (not a histogram), with a smooth curve and filled region\n\n##### Purpose\n\nThis visualization is intended to show the typical ride distance for casual users avoiding tourist destinations. It highlights the patterns in short-to-moderate-distance usage of the bike-sharing system.\n\n##### Observations\n\n-   Peak around 1–2 km: The majority of rides occur between stations that are 1–2 km apart.\n\n-   Steep decline: Ride density drops rapidly for distances above 5 km.\n\n-   Long tail: A small number of rides extend beyond 10 km, with rare outliers over 20 km.\n\n-   Very few extreme values: This confirms most rides are short-distance, utility-based.\n\n##### Interpretation\n\n-   The shape of the distribution suggests a strong preference for short-distance urban travel, which aligns with errand-running, last-mile commuting, or intra-neighborhood trips.\n\n-   The sharp tapering suggests little casual use for long-distance travel, at least outside of tourist-heavy areas.\n\n##### Technical Notes\n\n-   Ride distances were calculated using the great-circle distance (Haversine formula) between station coordinates.\n\n-   Tourist stations were excluded using a station filter based on known landmarks and locations.\n\n-   Density plots normalize the area under the curve to 1, so the y-axis values represent probability density, not raw ride counts.\n\n##### R Code Used to Generate Chart:\n\n```R\nggplot(non_loop_rides_df, aes(x = distance_km)) + \ngeom_density(fill = \"darkorange\", alpha = 0.6) +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"Non-Tourist_Customer_Distribution of Station-to-Station Distances\",\nx = \"Distance Between Stations (km)\",\ny = \"Density\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nRide Distance Distribution by Duration Cluster (Customer Rides Only) This density plot compares ride distances for non-tourist, non-loop customer rides, grouped into clusters based on ride duration. Short-duration rides are tightly concentrated around 1–2 km, medium-duration rides cover a broader 2–6 km range, and long-duration rides extend further, reflecting distinct usage behaviors within the same user group.\n\n\n\n\nThis kernel density plot illustrates the distribution of ride distances (in kilometers) for non-tourist, non-loop customer rides, broken out by ride duration clusters labeled as Short, Medium, and Long.\n\n\n\n\nX-Axis (Distance in km):\n\nRanges from 0 to 10 km.\nRepresents the straight-line distance from the start stations to the end stations (the minimum possilbe distatnce covered).

We break from the normal color scheme as more contrast was required due to the preexisting colors in the map. So the dots for subscriber stations rendered in blue and the dots for customer stations rendered in red. The dots for stations are offset slightly to avoid one dot obscuring the other for the cases where the station is in the top 50 for both subscribers and customers. This is accomplished by using a data frame where the location of the stations is offset.

The x-axis represents the distance in kilometers between two stations, and the y-axis represents the relative density of those ride distances.\n\n##### Chart Details\n\n-   X-Axis: Distance Between Stations (km), ranging from 0 to just over 30 km\n\n-   Y-Axis: Relative density of rides occurring at each distance\n\n-   Plot Style: Area-under-curve density plot (not a histogram), with a smooth curve and filled region\n\n##### Purpose\n\nThis visualization is intended to show the typical ride distance for casual users avoiding tourist destinations. It highlights the patterns in short-to-moderate-distance usage of the bike-sharing system.\n\n##### Observations\n\n-   Peak around 1–2 km: The majority of rides occur between stations that are 1–2 km apart.\n\n-   Steep decline: Ride density drops rapidly for distances above 5 km.\n\n-   Long tail: A small number of rides extend beyond 10 km, with rare outliers over 20 km.\n\n-   Very few extreme values: This confirms most rides are short-distance, utility-based.\n\n##### Interpretation\n\n-   The shape of the distribution suggests a strong preference for short-distance urban travel, which aligns with errand-running, last-mile commuting, or intra-neighborhood trips.\n\n-   The sharp tapering suggests little casual use for long-distance travel, at least outside of tourist-heavy areas.\n\n##### Technical Notes\n\n-   Ride distances were calculated using the great-circle distance (Haversine formula) between station coordinates.\n\n-   Tourist stations were excluded using a station filter based on known landmarks and locations.\n\n-   Density plots normalize the area under the curve to 1, so the y-axis values represent probability density, not raw ride counts.\n\n##### R Code Used to Generate Chart:\n\n```R\nggplot(non_loop_rides_df, aes(x = distance_km)) + \ngeom_density(fill = \"darkorange\", alpha = 0.6) +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"Non-Tourist_Customer_Distribution of Station-to-Station Distances\",\nx = \"Distance Between Stations (km)\",\ny = \"Density\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nRide Distance Distribution by Duration Cluster (Customer Rides Only) This density plot compares ride distances for non-tourist, non-loop customer rides, grouped into clusters based on ride duration.

Do not confuse this with the actual distance ridden, we have no way of knowing that from the currently available data.\n\nY-Axis (Density):\n\nRepresents the probability density of ride distances within each cluster.\nHigher peaks indicate more common distances in that cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort (Blue):\n\nPeaks sharply between 0.5–2.5 km.\nCharacterized by high density at shorter distances and a quick drop-off after 3 km.\n\nMedium (Green):\n\nPeaks broadly from ~2.5 km to 6 km.\nForms a wider and flatter distribution, indicating greater variability in ride lengths.\n\nLong (Red/Pink):\n\nStarts lower but maintains a relatively even presence across 3–10 km.\nLongest tail, with density extending up to the maximum distance shown (10 km).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort Cluster:\n\nHighest density of all clusters.\nIndicates that most customer rides classified as “short” are under 3 km.\nMay reflect last-mile or station-to-neighborhood travel.\n\nMedium Cluster:\n\nBroadest range of distances.\nOverlaps with both short and long clusters, suggesting transitional ride behavior.\n\nLong Cluster:\n\nLess frequent but not rare.\nRide distances in this group begin at approximatley 1.5 km and extend up to 10 km.\nPossibly includes destination-oriented or special-purpose trips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Insights:\n\nThe sharp peak of the short cluster implies highly consistent short-distance use, likely for errands or short hops.\nThe medium cluster suggests a flexible usage pattern, potentially including both commuting and recreational trips.\nLong-duration rides, although less common, cover the widest distance range, reflecting diverse travel purposes.\n\nData Characteristics:\n\nRides were filtered to exclude tourist, subscribers and loop rides, increasing the likelihood that these reflect practical customer travel behavior (e.g., commuting, errands).\nClustering these customer rides by duration helps uncover distinct usage patterns — such as short errand-like trips versus longer recreational journeys — without needing to segment riders any further or rely on additional metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart helps: - Understand ride behavior by duration across distance ranges. - Support clustering-based segmentation strategies. - Inform infrastructure placement, pricing models, or service design for non-tourist use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nFIGCAPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nLoop ride durations among non-tourist customers show a consistently skewed distribution, regardless of time of day or whether the ride occurred on a weekday or weekend. Ride length is typically short, with a rapid drop-off in frequency after the first 10–15 minutes across all hourly intervals.\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Loop Ride Length Distribution by Week Part and Time of Day Source: Non-tourist customer rides classified as “loop rides” (start and end at the same station) X-Axis: Ride Length (minutes) Y-Axis: Ride Count Faceting: 24 hourly bins (0–23), each split by weekday/weekend Color Encoding: Different fill colors for each Week.Part.Hour combination (e.g., Weekend.0, Weekday.14) shown in the legend\n\n\n\nConsistent Right Skew: In every hourly panel, ride length distributions are heavily skewed right, peaking in the 0–10 minute range and tapering off sharply.\n\nNo Strong Time-of-Day Effect: There is no significant shift in distribution shape across hours, though some hour blocks (e.g., mid-afternoon) show more total rides.\n\nLoop Behavior: This pattern reinforces the idea that many loop rides — likely recreational — are short and time-insensitive.\n\nWeekend vs. Weekday: Although both categories are shown, the duration distributions remain similar, suggesting time of day may be less influential for loop ride length than ride purpose or rider type.\n\n\n\nggplot(loop_rides_non_tourist, aes(x = ride_length_min, fill = interaction(week_part, hour_local))) \n+\ngeom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.5) +\nfacet_wrap(~ hour_local, ncol = 4) +\nlabs(title = \"Loop Ride Length Distribution by Week Part and Time of Day\",\nx = \"Ride Length (minutes)\",\ny = \"Ride Count\",\nfill = \"Week/Time\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section presents spatial insights into non-tourist customer rides, highlighting both where trips originate and terminate (station popularity) and how far riders typically travel between stations.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Is there a grammar for these .prj files?\nYes, there is a formal grammar for the Well-Known Text (WKT) that forms the content of ESRI .prj files. It’s a structured, machine-readable, and human-readable text markup language.\nThe WKT format was originally defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), and these specifications often include a formal grammar, typically in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). ESRI’s implementation, while largely adhering to these OGC standards (specifically WKT 1 for most .prj files), has had some minor variations or stricter interpretations.\n\nThe OGC WKT Standard and its Grammar\nThe definitive grammar for WKT (both WKT 1 and the newer WKT 2) comes from the OGC.\n\nWKT 1 (OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Reference Systems, 1999/2001): This is the version most commonly found in older .prj files. The specification details the syntax using a formal grammar (often expressed in EBNF). It defines keywords like GEOGCS, PROJCS, DATUM, SPHEROID, PRIMEM, UNIT, and PARAMETER, along with the rules for nesting them and their arguments.\nWKT 2 (ISO 19162:2015 and ISO 19162:2019): This is the more recent standard, aiming to be more robust, less ambiguous, and to fully align with the ISO 19111 conceptual model for Coordinate Reference Systems. It introduces new keywords (e.g., GEODCRS, PROJCRS) and a more explicit structure for elements like units and coordinate operations. Many modern GIS software and libraries are moving towards WKT 2.\n\n\n\nHow to Find the Grammar\nYou can typically find the formal grammar (EBNF) within the official OGC specifications themselves. These documents are publicly available from the OGC website. For instance, searching for “OGC WKT grammar EBNF” or “ISO 19162 EBNF” will lead you to relevant parts of these standards.\n###Key Aspects of the WKT Grammar\nThe grammar defines:\n\nKeywords: Specific capitalized terms (e.g., PROJCS, GEOGCS, DATUM, SPHEROID, UNIT, PARAMETER).\nStructure: How these keywords are nested using parentheses () or square brackets [] (historically, some implementations were flexible with these).\nParameters/Arguments: The types of values associated with each keyword (e.g., string names in double quotes ““, floating-point numbers for values like semi-major axis, inverse flattening, parameter values, or angular/linear unit conversion factors).\nSeparators: Commas , are used to separate elements within a keyword’s definition.\nOrder: The order of elements within a keyword’s definition is strictly defined by the grammar (e.g., for SPHEROID, the name comes first, then the semi-major axis, then inverse flattening).\n\n\n\nESRI’s Interpretation\nESRI’s software (like ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap) reads and writes .prj files that adhere to a specific WKT syntax. While it largely matches OGC WKT 1, there have been historical nuances:\n\nCase Sensitivity: ESRI’s WKT is generally case-sensitive for keywords.\nWhitespace: While the OGC standard technically allows for minimal whitespace, ESRI .prj files are typically written as a single, continuous string without line breaks for maximum compatibility, though parsing software is often forgiving.\nNames: ESRI often uses specific naming conventions for internal identifiers within the WKT string (e.g., GCS_WGS_1984 instead of just WGS 84 for the GCS name).\nTOWGS84 Clause: As mentioned before, this clause was sometimes used in ESRI WKT 1 to embed datum transformation parameters. However, ESRI’s projection engine usually handles transformations dynamically rather than solely relying on this embedded information.\n\nIn essence, while ESRI .prj files adhere to a WKT grammar, it’s best to consider them as following the OGC WKT 1 specification, with ESRI’s specific naming conventions and occasional minor deviations. When dealing with WKT from different sources, it’s always good practice to use a robust geospatial library (like GDAL/PROJ) that can parse various WKT flavors and perform transformations accurately."

    "text": "You’re diving into the fundamental concepts of geodesy, which are crucial for understanding how GIS data accurately represents locations on Earth!\nLet’s break down NAD83 and the GRS 1980 spheroid.\n\nNAD83 (North American Datum of 1983)\nNAD83 is a horizontal and geometric control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. In simpler terms, it’s a reference system that defines the latitude and longitude coordinates of points on the Earth’s surface within North America.\nHere’s what that means:\n\nDatum: A datum is a defined reference surface (like a spheroid) and a set of precisely measured points that are used to establish a coordinate system. It provides a fixed, known base from which all other points are measured.\nHorizontal and Geometric: This refers to the measurement of positions in terms of latitude and longitude (horizontal) and also accounting for the three-dimensional geometry of the Earth.\nGeocentric Origin: Unlike its predecessor (NAD27), NAD83 has its origin (0,0,0 point) at the Earth’s center of mass. This makes it more compatible with satellite-based positioning systems like GPS.\nDevelopment: NAD83 was released in 1986, using both ground-based and satellite observations (including GPS) to create a more accurate and consistent network of control points across the continent. It superseded the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27), which was based on older technologies and a different reference ellipsoid.\nRealizations: Over time, with improved technology and more observations, NAD83 has undergone several adjustments (or “realizations”) to improve its accuracy. Examples include NAD83(CORS96), NAD83(NSRS2007), and NAD83(2011). While these are adjustments, they are still considered part of the same NAD83 datum.\nRelation to WGS84: When first published, NAD83 and WGS84 (World Geodetic System of 1984, which GPS natively uses) were considered virtually identical. However, because WGS84 is a global datum tied to the Earth’s center of mass and dynamic with respect to plate tectonics, while NAD83 is generally fixed to the North American tectonic plate, they have slowly drifted apart over time (typically by 1-2 meters). For most everyday mapping and GIS at larger scales, the differences might be negligible, but for high-precision surveying, transformations between them are necessary.\n\n\n\nGRS 1980 Spheroid (Geodetic Reference System 1980)\nThe GRS 1980 spheroid (often referred to as GRS80) is a mathematical model of the Earth’s shape that is used as the reference ellipsoid for the NAD83 datum.\nHere’s what that means:\n\nSpheroid (or Ellipsoid): The Earth is not a perfect sphere; it bulges slightly at the equator and is flattened at the poles, resembling an oblate spheroid. A spheroid is a mathematically defined, smooth surface that approximates the Earth’s actual shape.\nParameters: Spheroids are defined by two key parameters:\n\nSemi-major axis (equatorial radius): The radius from the center to the equator. For GRS 1980, this is 6,378,137 meters.\nInverse flattening: A value that describes how much the spheroid is flattened at the poles. For GRS 1980, this is approximately 1/298.257222101.\n\nGlobal Standard: GRS 1980 was adopted by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in 1979 as a global standard.\nAccuracy: It is a modern, satellite-determined spheroid that provides a more accurate representation of the Earth’s shape compared to older, ground-measured ellipsoids (like the Clarke 1866 spheroid used by NAD27).\nNear Identical to WGS84 Ellipsoid: The GRS 1980 spheroid is very nearly identical in its dimensions to the WGS 1984 ellipsoid, which is why NAD83 and WGS84 were initially considered equivalent.\n\nIn essence, NAD83 is the system of coordinates used in North America, and the GRS 1980 spheroid is the mathematical model of the Earth’s shape that serves as the foundation for those coordinates. The datum (NAD83) tells you where the coordinate system starts and how it’s oriented, while the spheroid (GRS 1980) defines the shape of the Earth that the coordinates are mapped onto."

The bulk of the data (June 2013 through Sep 2019) (Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv) was obtained from the City of Chicago Data Portal. The rest (Oct 2019 through Jan 23 2020 and Jun 2023 – April 30 225) was downloaded from Divvy’s S3 archive . Please note, rides from the time period of the COVID-19 Pandemic are not included.\nChicago Weather Data (Hourly): Hourly weather data for Midway International Airport (station ID: 72534) was downloaded from the Metostat bulk archive. The dataset includes temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and other key weather indicators for correlation with bike usage patterns.\nTourist Attractions Dataset (Custom): A manually curated dataset of key tourist attractions in Chicago (e.g., Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Willis Tower) was created to identify rides likely associated with tourism. Latitude and longitude coordinates were obtained using Google Maps for educational use and spatial filtering.\n\n\n🔗 Attribution\n\nCity of Chicago. (2025).

    "text": "Glossary of Terms\nThis glossary defines key terms used throughout the case study.\n\n\n\nAverage Daily Rides\n\nThe total number of rides for a specific category (e.g., bike type or user type), divided by the number of days in the analysis period. This metric normalizes ride volume to allow comparisons across bike types or groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nBucket\n\nA predefined range used to group continuous data, such as ride counts or temperatures, for aggregation or visualization. For example, ride counts per bike may be grouped into 100-ride buckets.\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster (Ride Duration Cluster)\n\nA grouping of rides based on their duration using a clustering algorithm or predefined thresholds. In this study, rides are grouped into Short, Medium, and Long clusters to distinguish different usage behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\n\nA user who does not have an annual or recurring membership. Customers include Day Pass riders, single-ride users, and other casual or pay-per-use riders. All non-subscriber users are classified as customers. The term casual rider might also be used for customers, but for this case study only the term customer is used.\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity Plot (Kernel Density Plot)\n\nA smoothed visualization of the distribution of a continuous variable, such as ride distance. It estimates the probability density function and often provides clearer insight than a histogram by reducing noise through smoothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaversine formula\n\nA mathematical formula used to cacluate the distance between any two points on a sphere along the great-arc going through both points.\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel\n\nA mathematical function (usually bell-shaped) used in kernel density estimation to create a smooth curve over individual data points. The width and shape of the kernel affect how smoothed the resulting density plot is.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Ride\n\nA bike ride that starts and ends at the same station. Often used as a proxy for recreational or tourist behavior. These rides are excluded from this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Simultaneous Rides\n\nThe maximum number of rides that were active at the same time during a given period (e.g., a year). Calculated by tracking ride start and end events, computing a running total of concurrent rides, and taking the peak value. This metric is used to assess fleet load and system demand during peak usage periods. Also know as peak concurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Tourist Ride\n\nA ride that does not start or end near designated tourist destinations. These rides are considered more likely to reflect routine or local travel behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Tourist Station\n\nA station not in or near a designated tourist destinations. These stations are considered to be more frequented by commuters.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalization (Normalized Ride Volume)\n\nThe process of scaling data, typically between 0 and 1, to allow for comparisons across categories with different absolute values. For example, normalized ride volume allows temperature-based comparisons regardless of the overall number of rides.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak Concurrency\n\nThe highest number of bike rides occurring simultaneously within a given time window (e.g., a day, month, or year). In this study, peak concurrency is equivalent to the maximum number of bikes in use at the same time, calculated using ride start and end times. Also referred to as max simultaneous rides. This metric helps assess system load, infrastructure limits, and usage spikes.\n\n\n\n\n\nRide Count per Bike\n\nThe total number of rides recorded for an individual bike over the dataset’s time span. Used to evaluate fleet utilization and wear.\n\n\n\n\n\nRide Distance (km)\n\nThe distance between start and end stations, caclulated using the Haversine formula, and measured in kilometers. Used as a proxy for trip length and user intent.\n\n\n\n\n\nRide Duration\n\nThe difference between ride end_time and start_time.\n\n\n\n\n\nStation\n\nA docking location where bikes or scooters can be picked up or returned. Used in geographic and behavioral analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscriber\n\nA user who holds an annual or annual-billed-monthly membership with the bike-sharing service. Subscribers might also be know as members, but for the purpose of this case study only the term Subscriber is used.\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Type\n\nA classification of users based on their relationship with the bike-share system, for the purpose of this case study the are devided into two groups, Subscribers or Customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\nA graphical representation of data, such as bar charts, histograms, or density plots, used to communicate patterns and insights from the dataset."

    "text": "Regrets\n\nSQLite - I chose SQLite because I wanted something light weight and thought it would be a good opportunity to learn another database that seems to be a fairly popular choice. Overall I’m impressed with SQLite, it couldn’t be easier to setup and the performance was impressive. There were however two main issue I had with SQLite;\n\n1 Locks - When attempting to do my initial import I ran into a locking issue (Parse error: database is locked (5)) around 20K records. A single process inserting into the database, with no other process accessing the database really shouldn’t run into locking issues. I ended up doing the inserts in batches of 10K records and didn’t run into any more lock issues. 2 Missing functions - SQLite’s built‑in SQL dialect does not include STDDEV() or SQRT() and other functions I’m accustom to using in Oracle’s PL/SQL or MySQL’s SQL dialect. I didn’t know that until I tried using STDDEV() the first time. It is possible to add these functions with the extension‑functions add‑on. I compiled it with a little effort and was able to load it without error, but for some reason it still seemed to not recognize the added functions. It would have been more work to install MySQL but I’ve done that enough times that it would be easy and worth the work. You mileage my vary.\n\nLogging - You think to yourself, I’ll just cut and paste stuff from the console in RStudio that I’ll need later when I start writing this section up. Then you try and use library foo and it’s not there and without even think you install.packages(“foo”) and you know instantly your screwed as the voluminous output fills the buffer and the stuff you meant to cut and paste is gone. It’s just R though it could be SQL or your terminals buffer. I had RStudio crash more than one (in it’s defense I was working with a very large dataset for the amount of memory I had to work with). You need pedantic logging of everything.\nVersion Control - If you don’t do this already, get everything you can into the revision control system of your choice. Make it a habit. It’s too easy to start working on something you expect to be short and simple and it turns into something quite involved and you make some changes and they don’t work so you reverse them (or at least you think you do) but it still doesn’t work. git diff is your friend."

    "title": "Understanding .prj Files in GIS: Your Geospatial Data’s Silent Interpreter",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the world of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), data isn’t just about points, lines, and polygons; it’s also about where those features exist on Earth. This is where the .prj file comes in. A .prj file is a fundamental component of many geospatial datasets, particularly ESRI Shapefiles. It’s a plain text file that acts as the essential blueprint, defining the coordinate system and projection information for the accompanying spatial data.\n\nWhat’s Inside a .prj File?\nThe .prj file contains a precise, machine-readable description of the spatial reference system. This description is typically formatted in Well-Known Text (WKT), a standardized string that details how the data’s coordinates relate to a real-world location and how they are displayed on a flat map.\nA WKT string can specify both Geographic Coordinate Systems (GCS) and Projected Coordinate Systems (PCS):\n\nGeographic Coordinate System (GCS): This defines the global, spherical coordinate system. It includes:\n\nDatum: The model of the Earth’s shape (an ellipsoid or spheroid) and its position relative to the Earth’s center (e.g., WGS84, NAD83).\nSpheroid/Ellipsoid: The specific mathematical model of the Earth’s shape used by the datum.\nPrime Meridian: The reference longitude (usually Greenwich).\nAngular Unit: The unit for latitude and longitude (e.g., degrees).\n\nProjected Coordinate System (PCS): This defines how the 3D GCS coordinates are transformed onto a 2D flat plane, enabling measurement and mapping on a flat surface. It includes:\n\nProjection Type: The mathematical method used for the transformation (e.g., Transverse Mercator, Lambert Conformal Conic, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)).\nProjection Parameters: Specific values needed by the chosen projection, such as False Easting, False Northing, Central Meridian, Scale Factor, and Latitude of Origin.\nLinear Unit: The unit of measurement for the projected coordinates (e.g., meters, US survey feet).\n\nAuthority: Often includes an EPSG code (e.g., AUTHORITY[“EPSG”,“4326”] for WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System), which is a standardized code for a specific coordinate system definition.\n\n.prj files often also include an EPSG code, which is a standardized identifier for a specific coordinate system definition, allowing software to easily recognize and apply it.\nExample of a (simplified) .prj file content:\nPROJCS[\"NAD_1983_StatePlane_Washington_South_FIPS_4602_Ft_US\",GEOGCS[\"GCS_NAD_1983\",DATUM[\"D_NAD_1983\",SPHEROID[\"GRS_1980\",6378137.0,298.257222101]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0],UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION[\"Lambert_Conformal_Conic\"],PARAMETER[\"False_Easting\",1640416.666666667],PARAMETER[\"False_Northing\",0.0],PARAMETER[\"Central_Meridian\",-120.5833333333333],PARAMETER[\"Standard_Parallel_1\",45.83333333333334],PARAMETER[\"Standard_Parallel_2\",47.33333333333334],PARAMETER[\"Latitude_Of_Origin\",45.33333333333334],UNIT[\"Foot_US\",0.3048006096012192]]\n(Note: In actual files, this is often a single, very long line with no extra spaces for compactness.)\n\n\nWhy is a .prj File Important in GIS?\nThe .prj file is critically important because it provides the necessary context for GIS software to correctly interpret, display, and analyze your spatial data. Without it, the software lacks the crucial information needed to understand where on Earth your data is located or how it should be presented.\nHere’s why it’s so vital:\n\nAccurate Display and Alignment: Without the .prj file, GIS software cannot correctly position your data on a map. Data might appear in the wrong location, be severely stretched or compressed, or even be completely invisible when overlaid with other layers.\nReliable Analysis: All spatial analysis operations (like calculating areas, distances, buffers, or performing overlays) depend on accurate coordinate system information. An incorrect or missing .prj file will lead to erroneous analytical results.\nInteroperability: GIS involves combining datasets from many sources. The .prj file enables “on-the-fly” projection, allowing GIS software to transform data from different coordinate systems into a common system for seamless integration and comparison.\nData Integrity: It ensures that your data retains its spatial meaning and integrity as it’s moved between different systems or shared with other users.\n\nWhile some older GIS software or workflows might allow you to work without a .prj file (by making assumptions), this is highly discouraged. A missing or incorrect .prj file is a common source of error and frustration in GIS.\n\n\nHow .prj Files are Typically Used\n\nCompanion File: For formats like the ESRI Shapefile, the .prj file is a companion file that carries the same base filename as the main data files (e.g., rivers.shp, rivers.dbf, rivers.shx, and rivers.prj) and resides in the same directory. GIS software automatically looks for it when loading the dataset.\nMetadata: It serves as vital metadata, explicitly defining the spatial reference properties that are not stored within the primary data file itself.\nProgrammatic Use: GIS software and libraries (like GDAL/OGR or ArcPy) can read, parse, and generate .prj files to ensure proper data handling and transformations.\n\nIn essence, the .prj file is the unsung hero of GIS data, providing the crucial spatial context that allows your maps to be accurate, your analyses to be valid, and your data to be truly meaningful in the real world.\n\n\nSources\n\nWhat is Data Mapping?

    "text": "Introduction\nThe soft hum of your GPU fans is a soothing backdrop as you monitor a complex data extraction, a mountain of zipped archives, purportedly filled with nothing but clean CSVs, is steadily being processed. You’ve automated most of it, trusting your script fu to handle the grunt work. But then, a subtle deviation,\nFile not found: Divvy_Stations_2013.shp.csv\nthat wasn’t expected. You curse yourself for not having better error handling, but these files were suppose to all follow the same naming convention. “Dot-s-h-p-dot-c-s-v” you mumble. What the hell is that? So you go looking for Divvy_Stations_2013.shp.zip, as that’s what would have been needed for it to be looking for Divvy_Stations_2013.shp.csv, to see what’s up.\nYou find it and it looks like it’s contents have been extracted into a directory named Divvy_Stations_2013.shp\nYou lean closer, a frown creasing your brow. Not a log, not a CSV file in sie and a bunch of files with extensions do recognize. You call upon your most reliable digital ally, the venerable file command, for its infallible wisdom.\nYou (to yourself, a quiet murmur): “Alright, file, old friend. Time to shed some light on this mystery.”\n(You type the command, the bytes of the file streaming through your discerning companion.)\n$ file *\nThe response appears, but it’s not the confident classification you expected. Instead, the file command’s output seems to be a slightly perplexed, glowing text on your screen, its usual stoic confidence replaced by a rare flicker of uncertainty.\nDivvy_Stations_2013.dbf: FoxBase+/dBase III DBF, 300 records * 319, update-date 114-2-6, codepage ID=0x57, at offset 193 1st record \"        5.000000State St & Harrison St                                                                                         \"\nDivvy_Stations_2013.prj: ASCII text, with no line terminators\nDivvy_Stations_2013.sbn: ESRI Shapefile version 738263040 length 1598\nDivvy_Stations_2013.sbx: ESRI Shapefile version 738263040 length 170\nDivvy_Stations_2013.shp: ESRI Shapefile version 1000 length 4250 type Point\nDivvy_Stations_2013.shx: ESRI Shapefile version 1000 length 1250 type Point\n“ASCII text, with no line terminators”, file didn’t know what it was, I think to myself.\nUNIX file Command (its glowing text box pulsing faintly): “Hmph. Divvy_Stations_2013.prj: ASCII text. That’s all I’ve got. I pride myself on recognizing the very soul of a file, its intrinsic nature, regardless of its flimsy namesake suffix. I know what a .csv is by its comma-separated heart, a .json by its curly-bracketed spirit, even a .tar.gz by its compressed archiveyness. But this… this .prj file. Its contents whisper of structure, of a world’s placement, of coordinates and projections… yet, my internal knowledge base, vast as it is, draws a blank when I analyze its raw essence alone. I can only infer it’s ‘ASCII text’ But it feels like so much more.”\nThe file command’s manifestation seems to sigh, its light dimming slightly in digital frustration. Suddenly, a new option pops up on your screen, a prompt for a deeper interaction: “Help file Recognize .prj?”\nUNIX file Command (its glow returning with renewed purpose): “If you, astute data wrangler, could delve into its depths and help me understand this .prj type – not merely by its extension, but by its very content, its internal patterns, its Well-Known Text signature… it would be an invaluable addition to my wisdom. It would empower me to instantly classify such files for all your future data extractions, making me truly complete in the realm of geospatial information. Will you embark on this small, yet intellectually profound, Quest for .prj Enlightenment?”\nThis quest will challenge you to apply your knowledge of GIS data structures and delve into the specifics of .prj files to enhance your trusted command-line companion’s capabilities.\nYou of course accept the quest as your always up for a challenge, but where to start. Well file said it was ASCII so let’s have a look at it with cat. Wait first we should see how big it is.\n$ ls -l Divvy_Stations_2013.prj \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 sas sas 145 Feb  6  2014 Divvy_Stations_2013.prj\nIt’s small so …\n$ cat Divvy_Stations_2013.prj\nGEOGCS[\"GCS_WGS_1984\",DATUM[\"D_WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS_1984\",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0],UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]\nThat looks a little bit like GIS stuff, I don’t know much about that (if that’s what it is). Let’s consult one of the modern day oracles. So a quick trip on the Internet takes us to the Temple of OpenAI where we ask the oracle ChatGPT. Together with an offering of tokens you submit this prompt to the oracle.\nwhat does this look like, it's in a filename with the .prj extension?\nGEOGCS[\"GCS_WGS_1984\",DATUM[\"D_WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS_1984\",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0],UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]\nAfter what seems like a long time the oracle responds\n\nThat .prj file is simply the Well-Known Text (WKT) definition of the dataset’s coordinate reference system. In your &gt; case it tells you that everything is in plain latitude/longitude on the WGS 84 datum. Here’s what each bit means:\n\n**GEOGCS[“GCS_WGS_1984”] This declares a Geographic Coordinate System called “WGS 1984” (i.e. not a projected system).\nDATUM[“D_WGS_1984”,SPHEROID[“WGS_1984”,6378137.0,298.257223563]] Defines the datum** (“D_WGS_1984”) and its reference ellipsoid (“WGS_1984”) with\nSemi-major axis = 6 378 137.0 m\n\nInverse flattening = 298.257223563\n\nPRIMEM[“Greenwich”,0.0] Sets the prime meridian at Greenwich (0° longitude).\nUNIT[“Degree”,0.0174532925199433] Says coordinates are measured in degrees, where 1 degree = 0.01745… radians.\n\nIn practice: any GIS or mapping tool reading that .prj will know your data’s points are in un-projected WGS84 lat/long. If you need to display or analyze it alongside data in another CRS (say UTM or Web Mercator), you’d re-project using that definition as the source.\n\n“Oracles speak in riddles because the gods do not tell plain truths to mortals.” Well, it confirms my hunch that this is GIS related, but now we have more questions and how can we possible tell file he didn’t know what something that was “Well-Known Text” was. The shame would be too much.\nMy tokens exhausted I leave the temple to find more answers, since now I have more questions now.\nWalking along wonder how to proceed, I mentally kick myself even getting into the thing. Then it hits me I don’t need to know all this GIS stuff, I just need to know enough to help file out. I might not have any more tokens but I do have a digital assistant at my disposal.\nSo I ask my digital assistant Gemini to find out what the hell “WGS 84 datum” means. while I get to work restating my purpose, because I’m getting off track and I want to knock this out and get back to importing those CSV files.\n\n\n🎯 Purpose\nEnable the UNIX file utility to recognize ESRI .prj projection files based on their content (not file extension), which follow a Well-Known Text (WKT) format. I don’t need to know everything about GIS, just enough to give file the info it needs.\n\n\n🔷 Gemini Returns\nWell Gemini what did you find out?\n\nThe World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) is the global standard for defining the Earth’s size and shape and for precisely locating positions on its surface. It’s much more than just a coordinate system; it’s a comprehensive geodetic datum that serves as the fundamental reference for almost all modern geospatial applications, most notably the Global Positioning System (GPS).\nHere’s a breakdown of what WGS 84 encompasses and its key characteristics:\nWhat is a Geodetic Datum?\nBefore diving into WGS 84, it’s helpful to understand what a “geodetic datum” is. A geodetic datum is a reference system that defines how positions are represented on the Earth. It includes:\n\nA Coordinate System: A framework (like latitude, longitude, and height) for specifying locations.\nA Reference Ellipsoid (or Spheroid): A smooth, mathematical model of the Earth’s shape, which is an oblate spheroid (a sphere flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator). This ellipsoid is used as the surface on which latitude and longitude are defined.\nAn Origin and Orientation: Defines where the coordinate system starts and how it’s aligned in space relative to the Earth.\n\nKey Characteristics of WGS 84\nWGS 84 is defined and maintained by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and has several important characteristics:\n1 Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF): * Its origin (0,0,0) is located at the Earth’s geometric center of mass, including oceans and atmosphere.\n\nIts axes are fixed relative to the Earth’s crust, meaning they rotate with the Earth. This makes it ideal for global positioning as it provides a consistent reference frame for points on the moving Earth.\n\n2 Global Coverage:\n\nUnlike older, local datums (which were optimized for specific regions and could have significant discrepancies when moving across boundaries), WGS 84 provides a seamless, consistent reference frame for the entire globe.\n\n3 Reference Ellipsoid:\n\nWGS 84 uses its own specific reference ellipsoid (also called WGS 84 ellipsoid) with defined semi-major and semi-minor axes, and a flattening factor. This ellipsoid provides the mathematical surface for defining latitude and longitude.\n\n4 Reference for GPS:\n\nWGS 84 is the primary geodetic datum used by the Global Positioning System (GPS). All GPS receivers output coordinates in WGS 84 latitude, longitude, and ellipsoidal height by default. This makes it universally compatible with GPS devices and applications worldwide.\n\n5 Dynamic Nature (with Realizations):\n\nWhile WGS 84 is defined by a fixed set of parameters, the Earth’s surface is constantly changing due to tectonic plate movement, post-glacial rebound, and other geological processes.\nTo maintain high accuracy, WGS 84 is periodically updated through “realizations” (e.g., WGS 84 (G1762) being a more recent realization). These updates align WGS 84 with the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), which incorporates global geodetic observations with very high precision. For most common uses, the differences between WGS 84 realizations are negligible, but for very high-precision applications, the specific realization used is important.\n\n6 Components: WGS 84 technically comprises:\n\nAn ellipsoid\nA horizontal datum (for latitude and longitude)\nA vertical datum (for ellipsoidal height)\nA coordinate system\n\n7 Associated Models: WGS 84 also includes associated models like the Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) and the World Magnetic Model (WMM), which describe Earth’s gravity and magnetic fields, respectively.\nPurpose and Importance\nThe main purposes of WGS 84 are:\n\nStandardization: To provide a single, consistent, and globally applicable reference system for geospatial information, enabling seamless data exchange and interoperability across different countries, organizations, and applications.\nNavigation: To serve as the foundation for satellite navigation systems like GPS, allowing accurate positioning and navigation worldwide. Mapping and GIS: To provide a fundamental framework for creating maps, charts, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data that are globally consistent.\nScientific Research: To support various geoscientific studies, including monitoring Earth’s gravity field, sea level changes, and tectonic plate movements.\n\nIn essence, WGS 84 is the invisible framework that underpins much of our modern world’s location-based technologies and understanding of the Earth.\n\nWell, I think I’m starting to understand that this GIS stuff is a little complicated. We need to hone in on the info we need a little more. Can you create a report for me about .prj files in the context of GIS? While I figure out what has to be done to get file to recognize these files once we have the information. I’ll ask my friend man, he knows about almost all the commands.\n\n\n📄 Custom magic File Snippet\nFilename: .magic or magic.local\n0   string  GEOGCS[        ESRI WKT projection file (geographic)\n0   string  PROJCS[        ESRI WKT projection file (projected)\n0   string  LOCAL_CS[      ESRI WKT projection file (local coordinate system)\n&gt;0  string  DATUM[         (with DATUM)\n&gt;0  string  SPHEROID[      (with SPHEROID)\n\n0   search/20   DATUM[     ESRI WKT projection file (WKT with DATUM)\n0   search/20   SPHEROID[  ESRI WKT projection file (WKT with SPHEROID)\n\n!:mime  text/plain\nUsage:\nfile -m ~/.magic somefile\nSupports detection even if the file has no .prj extension."

    "text": "📊 Chart Description: Normalized Average Hourly Rides vs Temperature\n\n  \n\nNormalized average hourly rides by temperature (°C), showing subscriber, customer, and total ride volume peaking near 25°C.\n\n\nThis line chart displays how bike ride frequency varies with temperature, separated by user type. The data is normalized, meaning each line ranges from 0 to 1 to emphasize the shape of the trend rather than absolute ride counts. The x-axis shows temperature in degrees Celsius, and the y-axis shows normalized average hourly rides.\nThere are three colored lines:\n\nDark blue line for Subscribers\nDark orange line for Customers\nBlack line for the Total (combined average)\n\n\n\n📈 What the chart shows:\nAll three lines follow a similar bell-shaped curve, indicating that ride volume increases with temperature up to a point and then declines slightly.\n\nBelow 5°C:\n\nAll lines are low. Subscribers still ride more than customers, but both are at their lowest levels.\n\nFrom 5°C to 25°C:\n\nAll user types increase their riding sharply, with customers increasing more rapidly than subscribers.\n\nAround 25°C:\n\nThe normalized ride volume peaks for all users. This temperature appears to be optimal for biking.\n\nBeyond 30°C:\n\nRide volume begins to decline slightly, especially for customers, suggesting heat discourages casual riding more than subscriber riding.\n\n\n\n\n📊 Comparison by User Type:\nCustomers (dark orange line) are more sensitive to temperature changes. They ride less in the cold and more in warm weather, but their participation falls more steeply when it's too hot.\n\nSubscribers (dark blue line) have a flatter, more stable curve, meaning their ride behavior is more consistent across a range of temperatures, likely because they are commuting or riding out of necessity.\n\nThe Total line (black) always lies between the two other lines, as expected from an average.\n\n\n🔍 General Observations:\nThe shape of the curves is very similar across all user types, indicating that temperature influences casual customers and subscribers in a similar way — warmer weather increases ridership for everyone.\n\nThe \"total\" line (black) consistently lies between the customer (dark orange) and subscriber (dark blue) lines, as expected from an average or composite.\n\n\n🌡️ Temperature Effects:\n\nBelow ~5°C (≈ 41°F):\n\nAll ride volumes are low. This likely reflects discomfort, poor road conditions, or safety concerns — especially for casual riders.\n\n5°C to 25°C:\n\nSteady and significant rise in ride volume, particularly among customers. This temperature range is ideal for recreational and commuter use. It suggests good biking weather for most users.\n\nAround 25°C (~77°F):\n\nAppears to be the peak ridership temperature — the “sweet spot” for biking in Chicago (or similar climates), with maximum participation across both customer types.\n\nAbove 30°C (~86°F):\n\nSlight drop-off in ride frequency, especially among casual riders, implying that excessive heat becomes a deterrent to non-essential trips. Subscribers are less affected, possibly due to commuting needs or higher tolerance.\n\n\n\n\n🤔 Behavioral Insights (Celsius Context):\n|Temp Range (°C)|Customer Behavior|Subscriber Behavior|Interpretation| |&lt;5°C|Low ridership|Moderately low|Cold weather suppresses casual rides more strongly| |5–25°C|Steep increase|Moderate increase|Warm-up boosts ridership, especially casual use| |~25°C|Peak ridership|Near-peak|Ideal biking conditions for both groups| |&gt;30°C|Drop or plateau|Slight decline or steady|Hot weather reduces recreational riding|\n📊 Comparison by User Type:\n\nCustomers (dark orange line) are more sensitive to temperature changes. They ride less in the cold and more in warm weather, but their participation falls more steeply when it’s too hot.\nSubscribers (dark blue line) have a flatter, more stable curve, meaning their ride behavior is more consistent across a range of temperatures, likely because they are commuting or riding out of necessity.\nThe Total line (black) always lies between the two other lines, as expected from an average.\n\n\n\n✅ Conclusion:\nCasual users are more sensitive to weather extremes, while subscribers demonstrate more consistent use—likely reflecting commute and utility rather than leisure.\n\n\nProduction Details\n#####R source code used to produce the chart\nggplot(normalized_df, aes(x = temp_bin, y = normalized_rides, color = user_type)) +\n    geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Normalized Avg Hourly Rides vs Temperature\",\n        x = \"Temperature (°F)\",\n        y = \"Normalized Avg Hourly Rides\",\n        color = \"User Type\"\n    ) +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"subs\" = \"darkblue\", \"cust\" = \"darkorange\", \"avg\" = \"black\")) +\n    theme_minimal()\n\n\nData Source\nR Code Used to Generate the Chart:\n&gt; avg_df  &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"/data/temp_vs_rides_avg.csv\")\n&gt; # Normalize each column to 0-1\n&gt; normalized_df &lt;- avg_df %&gt;%\n+     mutate(across(c(subs, cust, avg), ~ (. - min(.)) / (max(.) - min(.)))) %&gt;%\n+     pivot_longer(cols = c(subs, cust, avg), names_to = \"user_type\", values_to = \"normalized_rides\")"

It provides insight into how evenly or unevenly individual bikes are used over the dataset’s timespan.\n\n\nAxes\n\nX-Axis (Ride Count Range):\n\nLabeled in bins of 100 rides (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, …, 5500-5599).\nRepresents the total number of rides associated with each bike.\n\nY-Axis (Number of Bikes):\n\nIndicates how many bikes fall within each ride count range.\nPeaks near 300 bikes in the most frequently occurring bins.\n\n\n\n\nVisual Elements\n\nBars:\n\nColored purple with black borders.\nUniform width, covering each 100-ride range.\nDistribution forms a roughly symmetric bell-shaped curve centered around the 2700–3499 range.\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\nLow-end Outliers:\n\nA noticeable spike in the 0–99 bin (~130 bikes), suggesting a set of bikes with extremely limited or no use.\nMay include stolen, damaged, or new bikes added near the end of the data collection period.\n\nCore Distribution:\n\nThe majority of bikes (~200–280 per bin) fall between 2200–3999 rides.\nIndicates typical usage patterns and operational consistency.\n\nHigh-end Tail:\n\nUsage drops off steadily after ~4000 rides per bike.\nVery few bikes exceed 5000 rides.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe chart implies a relatively well-utilized fleet with a normal distribution centered around ~3000 rides per bike.\nThe left-side spike at 0–99 highlights potential outliers worth investigating:\n\nUnderused bikes,\nPossible malfunctions,\nSeasonal deployments,\nRecent fleet additions.\n\nThe right tail shows some high-mileage bikes that may be candidates for maintenance or replacement soon.\n\n\n\nUse Case\nThis visualization is valuable for: - Fleet maintenance planning (identify overused/underused bikes), - Lifecycle analysis (detect uneven distribution of wear), - Deployment strategy (optimize rotation or redistribution).\n\n\nData Sources\nrides table in SQLite, queried for bike usage counts grouped by bike_id.\n\nSQL Query to Produce Aggregated Data\n.headers on\n.mode csv\n.output bike_ride_buckets.csv\nWITH bucketed AS (\n  SELECT\n    (ride_count / 100) * 100 AS bucket_start,\n    COUNT(*) AS bike_count\n  FROM (\n    SELECT bike_id, COUNT(*) AS ride_count\n    FROM rides\n    WHERE bike_id IS NOT NULL\n    GROUP BY bike_id\n  )\n  GROUP BY bucket_start\n  ORDER BY bucket_start\n)\nSELECT\n  bucket_start,\n  bucket_start + 99 AS bucket_end,\n  bike_count\nFROM bucketed;\n.output stdout\n\n\nGnuplot Script Used to Generate Chart:\nset datafile separator \",\"\nset terminal pngcairo size 1000,600 enhanced font 'Verdana,10'\nset output 'bike_ride_bucket_histogram.png'\n\nset title \"Distribution of Ride Counts per Bike\"\nset xlabel \"Ride Count Range\"\nset ylabel \"Number of Bikes\"\nset style fill solid 1.0 border -1\nset boxwidth 0.9\nset grid ytics\nunset key\nset xtics rotate by -45\n\n# Format x-tics with the bucket label, like \"0–99\"\nplot 'bike_ride_buckets.csv' using ($0):3:xtic(strcol(1).\"-\".strcol(2)) with boxes"
