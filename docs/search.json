We follow the normal color scheme with the dots for subscriber stations rendered in darkblue and the dots for customer stations rendered in darkorance. The dots for stations are offset slightly to avoid one dot obscuring the other for the cases where the station is in the top 50 for both subscribers and customers. This is accomplished by using a data frame where the location of the stations is offset.
