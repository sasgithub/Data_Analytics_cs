The bulk of the data (June 2013 through Sep 2019) (Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv) was obtained from the City of Chicago Data Portal. The rest (Oct 2019 through Jan 23 2020 and Jun 2023 ‚Äì April 30 225) was downloaded from Divvy‚Äôs S3 archive . Please note, rides from the time period of the COVID-19 Pandemic are not included.\nChicago Weather Data (Hourly): Hourly weather data for Midway International Airport (station ID: 72534) was downloaded from the Metostat bulk archive. The dataset includes temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and other key weather indicators for correlation with bike usage patterns.\nTourist Attractions Dataset (Custom): A manually curated dataset of key tourist attractions in Chicago (e.g., Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Willis Tower) was created to identify rides likely associated with tourism. Latitude and longitude coordinates were obtained using Google Maps for educational use and spatial filtering.\n\n\nüîó Attribution\n\nCity of Chicago. (2025).
