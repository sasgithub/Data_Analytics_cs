This is a screenshot of the Divvy Bicycle Stations Map from the City of Chicago Transportations web site. This image is referenced by the [workLog](https://github.com/sasgithub/Data_Analytics_cs/blob/main/logs/workLog.md) during the exploratory stage of the case study while searching for a street map of Chicago to use in my own visualizations.  This image was not used as a part of the case study.
