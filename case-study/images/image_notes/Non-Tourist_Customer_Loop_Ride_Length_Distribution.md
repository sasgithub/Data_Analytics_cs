  <figcaption>
  Loop ride durations among non-tourist customers show a consistently skewed distribution, regardless of time of day or whether the ride occurred on a weekday or weekend. Ride length is typically short, with a rapid drop-off in frequency after the first 10‚Äì15 minutes across all hourly intervals.

### üìù Image Notes

Title: Loop Ride Length Distribution by Week Part and Time of Day
Source: Non-tourist customer rides classified as "loop rides" (start and end at the same station)
X-Axis: Ride Length (minutes)
Y-Axis: Ride Count
Faceting: 24 hourly bins (0‚Äì23), each split by weekday/weekend
Color Encoding: Different fill colors for each Week.Part.Hour combination (e.g., Weekend.0, Weekday.14) shown in the legend

### Key Observations

    Consistent Right Skew: In every hourly panel, ride length distributions are heavily skewed right, peaking in the 0‚Äì10 minute range and tapering off sharply.

    No Strong Time-of-Day Effect: There is no significant shift in distribution shape across hours, though some hour blocks (e.g., mid-afternoon) show more total rides.

    Loop Behavior: This pattern reinforces the idea that many loop rides ‚Äî likely recreational ‚Äî are short and time-insensitive.

    Weekend vs. Weekday: Although both categories are shown, the duration distributions remain similar, suggesting time of day may be less influential for loop ride length than ride purpose or rider type.
