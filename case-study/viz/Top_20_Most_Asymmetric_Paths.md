##### Top 20 Most Asymmetric Paths by User Type

This side-by-side horizontal bar chart identifies the **20 most directionally imbalanced ride paths** (i.e., asymmetric) for each user type — **customers** on the left and **subscribers** on the right.

###### What is Asymmetry?
The **asymmetry ratio** is defined as:
> rides in one direction / total rides in both directions

Values closer to 1.0 indicate strong directional bias.

###### Key Observations:
- **Customer paths** tend to involve routes to and from major downtown hubs like Canal St, Clinton St, and Wacker Dr — possibly reflecting less predictable, one-way tourist or ad hoc travel.
- **Subscriber paths** are more concentrated near recreational or scenic areas like **Columbus Dr**, **Streeter Dr**, and **Lake Shore Dr**, hinting at commuting or habitual use involving these corridors.
- Subscribers' top asymmetric paths skew toward locations like **Millennium Park**, **McCormick Place**, and **DuSable Harbor**, supporting recreational or last-mile transit interpretations.
- Despite both groups sharing some geographical overlap, their most imbalanced paths differ significantly in direction and endpoint distribution.

This visualization helps highlight the behavioral contrast in directional ride patterns between user types.
