##### Overview

This side-by-side horizontal bar chart displays the **20 most directionally imbalanced station pairs** for each user type: **customers** and **subscribers**. These paths have the highest **asymmetry ratios**, indicating strong one-way usage patterns.

##### Chart Details

- **X-Axis**: Asymmetry Ratio (ranging up to ~1.0).
- **Y-Axis**: Station pair labels (listed within each bar).
- **Panels**:
  - **Left**: Top asymmetric paths for Customers.
  - **Right**: Top asymmetric paths for Subscribers.

##### Observations

- **Customers**:
  - Top asymmetric paths often involve major downtown locations such as Canal St, Clinton St, and Wacker Dr.
  - Patterns likely reflect tourism, drop-offs, or infrequent return trips.
- **Subscribers**:
  - Asymmetries cluster around recreational and waterfront areas such as Columbus Dr, Streeter Dr, Lake Shore Dr, Millennium Park, and McCormick Place.
  - Patterns suggest consistent commuting or recreational flows.

##### Interpretation

- **Asymmetry Ratio**:
  - Defined as:
    > rides in one direction / total rides between the two stations.
  - Values close to **1.0** mean most trips occur in a single direction.
- **Behavioral Insight**:
  - Customer asymmetry is oriented toward downtown ad hoc travel.
  - Subscriber asymmetry is more tied to commuting and lakefront destinations.
- **Comparison**:
  - Even when overlapping in geography, the dominant flow directions and endpoints differ between user groups.

##### Use Case

This visualization supports:

- Identifying rebalancing needs.
- Targeting incentive programs to encourage return trips.
- Understanding travel patterns for infrastructure planning and operational improvements.
