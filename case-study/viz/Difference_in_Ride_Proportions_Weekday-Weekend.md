##### üìù Image Notes

Title: Difference in Ride Proportions: Weekday - Weekend
X-axis: Hour of Day (0‚Äì23)
Y-axis: Arbitrary (used to create banded heatmap effect)
Color Scale:

-    Red: Higher ride proportion on weekdays
-    Blue: Higher ride proportion on weekends
-    White: No significant difference in proportion

Interpretation

-    Morning hours (~7‚Äì9 AM) and afternoon hours (~4‚Äì6 PM) are clearly more active on weekdays, likely driven by commuting.

-    Midday (10 AM‚Äì3 PM) shows a higher proportional share of rides on weekends, possibly indicating more recreational usage during these hours.
-    Nighttime hours (~8 PM onward) still lean toward weekday use, albeit more modestly.

This visualization normalizes by total weekday and weekend ride volume, enabling meaningful comparison of usage patterns across the day regardless of total volume differences.
