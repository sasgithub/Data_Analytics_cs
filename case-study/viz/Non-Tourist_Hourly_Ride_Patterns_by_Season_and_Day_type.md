##### Overview

This multi-panel grouped bar chart compares **hourly ride activity** across the four seasons, separated into **weekday** and **weekend** usage, restricted to non-tourist stations. It provides a clear view of how both **time of day** and **seasonality** influence ridership behavior among casual users.

##### Chart Details

- **X-Axis:** Hour of Day (0â€“23 in 24-hour format).
- **Y-Axis:** Number of Rides.
- **Bars:**
  - **Dark Blue:** Weekday rides.
  - **Dark Orange:** Weekend rides.
- **Facets:**
  - One panel per season: Fall, Spring, Summer, and Winter.
- **Position:** Bars are grouped side by side within each hour for comparison.

##### Purpose

The visualization aims to:
- Quantify the impact of **seasonal changes** on ridership volume.
- Identify **daily commute-like patterns** even among non-subscribers.
- Highlight how weekends differ from weekdays in temporal distribution.

##### Observations

- **Summer and Fall:**
  - Pronounced **weekday peaks around 17:00**, likely related to commuting or end-of-day activities.
  - Weekend ridership is elevated but spread more evenly across midday hours.
- **Spring:**
  - Similar but slightly lower weekday afternoon peaks.
- **Winter:**
  - Overall volume sharply reduced.
  - Flatter distribution throughout the day with only a mild afternoon increase on weekdays.

##### Interpretation

- Strong **weekday afternoon peaks** in warm months support the idea of commuting or routine trips by casual riders.
- Weekend rides remain relatively stable across seasons, indicating recreation and errands.
- Winter conditions significantly suppress all ride activity.

##### Technical Notes

- All rides are filtered to **exclude tourist stations**.
- Only rides by `customer` (non-subscriber) users are included.
- Local Chicago time used for hourly binning.
- Season assigned based on ride start date.

##### Data & Methods

Data source:
- `non_tourist_customer_rides_df`
  - Filtered for user_type = 1.
  - Filtered to non-tourist station IDs.

**R Code Used to Generate the Chart:**

```R
ggplot(rides_by_hour_season, aes(x = hour, y = ride_count, fill = week_part)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~season, ncol = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:23) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Weekday" = "darkblue", "Weekend" = "darkorange")) +
  labs(
    title = "Hourly Ride Patterns by Season and Day Type (Non-Tourist Stations)",
    x = "Hour of Day",
    y = "Number of Rides",
    fill = "Day Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
