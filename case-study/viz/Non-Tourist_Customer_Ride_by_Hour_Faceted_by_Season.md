### Interpretation

- **Commuting Behavior**: The sharp weekday peaks in summer and fall suggest commuter-driven use around 17:00, especially among customers using the system for one-way travel home from work or transit.
- **Seasonal Sensitivity**: Weekend ride patterns are flatter across the day and more seasonally stable, while weekday patterns show strong seasonal variation.
- **Cold Weather Impact**: Winter reduces both weekday and weekend ride volumes significantly, confirming seasonality in casual rider behavior.
