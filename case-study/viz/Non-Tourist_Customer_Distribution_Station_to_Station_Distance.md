##### Overview

This density plot visualizes the distribution of **station-to-station distances** for rides taken by **customer (non-subscriber) riders** that do not involve tourist stations. The x-axis represents the distance in kilometers, and the y-axis shows the relative density of rides occurring at each distance.

##### Chart Details

- **X-Axis:** Distance Between Stations (km), ranging from 0 to ~30 km  
- **Y-Axis:** Relative probability density of rides at each distance  
- **Plot Style:** Smoothed density plot (not a histogram), area under the curve normalized to 1  

##### Purpose

This chart highlights the typical distance casual riders travel between stations when tourist hotspots are excluded, revealing patterns in local, everyday bike-share use.

##### Observations

- **Peak around 1 km:** Most rides are short hops between closely spaced stations.
- **Steep decline:** Density drops quickly after ~5 km.
- **Long tail:** A small number of rides extend past 10 km.
- **Very few extreme values:** Rides over 20 km are rare outliers.

##### Interpretation

- The pronounced twin peaks around 1 km suggests **short-distance, utility-oriented trips**, like errands or first-/last-mile commuting.
- The long but thin tail implies that while occasional longer rides occur, they are uncommon among non-tourist customer riders.
- The lack of a multiple wide spaced peaks differentiates this distribution from tourist-heavy patterns, which often show multiple modes due to popular routes.

##### Technical Notes

- **Distance Calculation:** Great-circle distance (Haversine formula) computed between station coordinates.
- **Filtering:** Tourist stations excluded via station ID filtering.
- **Density Scaling:** The y-axis shows density, not raw counts. The area under the curve sums to 1.

```r
ggplot(non_loop_rides_df, aes(x = distance_km)) +
  geom_density(fill = "darkorange", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Non-Tourist Customer Distribution of Station-to-Station Distances",
    x = "Distance Between Stations (km)",
    y = "Density"
