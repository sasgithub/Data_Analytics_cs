ðŸ“Š Key Findings

1. Distinct Behavioral Patterns by User Type

Members ride more consistently across the year, with noticeable commuting patterns (peak usage during weekday rush hours).

Casual riders are more likely to ride during weekends, midday, and on longer rides, suggesting recreational or tourist use.

Loop rides (same start and end station) are far more common among casual riders.

2. Modest Weather Influence

Contrary to expectations, weather appears to have only a weak correlation with ride volumeâ€”especially for casual users.

Ride counts drop off at temperature extremes, but these are rare and account for a small proportion of total rides.

The differences in riding patterns are not sufficiently explained by weather conditions alone.

3. Station Usage Differences

Casual riders tend to use stations near tourist attractions and waterfront areas.

Members make more geographically distributed use of stations, especially those in residential and employment areas.

The top 50 most used stations by casual riders differ substantially from those used by members.

ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. Target Casual Riders Who Behave Like Members

Offer trial memberships or time-limited discounts to casual users with consistent riding patterns.

Focus marketing on casual riders using stations in residential areas or during weekday commute times.

2. Expand Station Coverage in Underused Member Areas

Evaluate station availability in key member-heavy corridors.

Add or rebalance stations in locations where members are under-served.

3. Develop Recreational and Tourist-Focused Promotions

Bundle ride passes with tourist attractions or offer weekend/family packages.

Use geofencing or email promotions for riders using top tourist stations.

4. Rethink Weather-Based Assumptions

Avoid overinvesting in weather-based marketing; seasonality may be more cultural than temperature-driven.

Consider that casual ridership in mild seasons is not strictly weather-dependent, and may be driven by tourism patterns, events, or schedule availability.

These findings reflect observed behaviors in the 2020â€“2025 Divvy dataset, with supplemental weather data from Midway Airport.
