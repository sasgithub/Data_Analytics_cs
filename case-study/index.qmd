# How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

This project began as the capstone case study for the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), which presents a fictional company named **Cyclistic**. The business goal:  
**Determine how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and identify strategies to convert more casual users into annual members.**

To bring this scenario into the real world, I extended the analysis using **actual Divvy bike-share data** from the City of Chicago, covering rides from 2013 through early 2025. I also incorporated **hourly weather data** and **geospatial analysis** to enhance the depth and utility of the findings.

## Project Context

This project satisfies the requirements of the Google Data Analytics capstone while also serving as a portfolio piece demonstrating:

- Independent sourcing and integration of multi-year real-world data
- Use of tools beyond the course scope (e.g., SQLite, Leaflet, Tableau, shell scripting)
- Realistic data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis

The fictional business challenge of **Cyclistic** is explored through the lens of actual **Divvy** usage patterns.

## Business Task

How do casual riders and annual members use Divvy bikes differently, and how can that inform marketing strategies?

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following datasets:

- Divvy Bike Trip Data (2013â€“2025)[^note1] : This dataset includes anonymized ride-level data from Chicagoâ€™s Divvy bike sharing system. The bulk of the data (June 2013 through Sep 2019) (Divvy_Trips_20250501.csv) was obtained from the City of Chicago Data Portal.  The rest (Oct 2019 through Jan 23 2020 and Jun 2023 â€“ April 30 225) was downloaded from Divvyâ€™s S3 archive .  Please note, rides from the time period of the COVID-19 Pandemic are not included.
- Chicago Weather Data (Hourly): Hourly weather data for Midway International Airport (station ID: 72534) was downloaded from the Metostat bulk archive. The dataset includes temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and other key weather indicators for correlation with bike usage patterns.
- Tourist Attractions Dataset (Custom): A manually curated dataset of key tourist attractions in Chicago (e.g., Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Willis Tower) was created to identify rides likely associated with tourism. Latitude and longitude coordinates were obtained using Google Maps for educational use and spatial filtering.
